	<p>Getfused is a full-service digital marketing agency that uses an iterative, user-centric approach to meeting our clients’ business goals. Beginning in 1996 we were a group of digital consultants (read: nerds with a vision) focused on the development of high-quality websites, e-commerce platforms, intranets, and creating web-based applications that were the first of their kind. Since then we've come a long way.</p>
