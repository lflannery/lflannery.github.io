More than 300 guests lined the catwalk at the State Room for an evening filled with inspiration that went well beyond a Spring wardrobe. The event, emceed by <strong>WBZ-TV&rsquo;s Lisa Hughes</strong>, and chaired by <strong>Mariann Youniss</strong> and <strong>Kelly McDermott</strong>, raised a record-breaking amount of more than $160,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Looks ran the gamut from athletic to couture, and were supplied by our partners <a href=\"http://www.thestreetchestnuthill.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Street</strong></a> and Braintree-born, Northeastern alum now based in New York, designer, <a href=\"http://michaeldepaulo.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Michael De Paulo</strong></a>.

Generous bidders walked away with priceless packages that included African safaris, tickets to Big Papi&rsquo;s sold out final home game at Fenway, and a membership to Vermont&rsquo;s private ski and golf club The Hermitage. Guests also stepped up to make donations in support of matching more girls with a caring, supportive Big Sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Big thanks to our host committee, ticket buyers, auction bidders, and

/>\r\n<u><strong>THE INFLUENCE FACTOR</strong></u><br />\r\n<strong>Did you have mentors along the way in your career? </strong>Yes. I worked in corporate for 16 years. My passion was youth development. I met Robert Lewis Jr., who at the time was the head of City Year. He certainly was one of my mentors as I transitioned to the nonprofit sector. What I realized along the way was many of my mentors were men. Now, I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;m looked to as a mentor for many women in the Boston area.<br />\r\nTHE INFLUENCE FACTOR<br />\r\n<strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nDid you have mentors along the way in your career?</strong> Yes. I worked in corporate for 16 years. My passion was youth development. I met Robert Lewis Jr., who at the time was the head of City Year. He certainly was one of my mentors as I transitioned to the nonprofit sector. What I realized along the way was many of my mentors were men. Now, I&rsquo;m hoping that I&rsquo;m looked to as a mentor for many women in the Boston area.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Who do you turn to for advice today?</strong> I turn to my board members. I turn to my board president (Thomas L. Barrette Jr. of Holland and Knight). I also created a kitchen cabinet of trusted advisers and I&rsquo;m part of a women&rsquo;s executive nonprofit leadership group. Corrine Ferguson; Carolyn Casey, who runs Project 351; Harriet Lewis of Grand Circle Travel (and its foundation); Meredith Weenick, who was CFO for the city of Boston for many years.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nGrowing up as the only girl in a Roslindale family with five older brothers, it&rsquo;s not surprising that Deborah Re would seek out a few sisters. Today, she has more than 2,600 of them, as CEO of Big Sister Association of Greater Boston. The organization provides mentoring to girls in 69 Boston-area cities and towns, encouraging high school and college graduation and fostering self-esteem and confidence.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nRe (pronounced &ldquo;Ray&rdquo;) is in her 10th year heading Big Sister, following three years as executive director of City Year Boston. She previously spent 16 years in the corporate world at Keyport Life Insurance, rising to vice president.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlong with her only-girl status, Re&rsquo;s family stories include the assertion that she learned to run before she could walk, though of course she can&rsquo;t recall herself. A resident of Jamaica Plain with her husband, jazz musician Peter Reinhart, Re spoke with Business Journal correspondent Robin Washington.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>How hard is it to recruit Big Sisters? </strong>We have 2,200 one-to-one matches. We have 350 girls on the waitlist. Is it hard? It&rsquo;s not as simple as Match.com, that&rsquo;s for sure. It&rsquo;s not &ldquo;sign here and we&rsquo;ll match you with somebody.&rdquo; We do a background check, a CORI. We want to make sure that they are ready and that they&rsquo;re not going through their own transition. That they understand that this is not about being a tutor. This is not about being a parent. And that they&rsquo;re respecting the child and the child&rsquo;s family, so they&rsquo;re not imposing their values on the child. It is definitely a commitment. It is not a casual thing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>This is one case where there&rsquo;s not an app for that. </strong>That&rsquo;s exactly right. It has to be face-to-face. It&rsquo;s not through email, not through social media. They can (use social media) but it has to augment face-to-face. It is the consistency and the predictability that matters to that child. Girls especially base their self-esteem on their relationships. We want to make sure that the woman is prepared.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>What&rsquo;s your main activity as CEO? </strong>To grow our community. To educate and inspire people to understand issues impacting girls. To get people to become mentors, to get people to become donors and to connect to the Greater Boston community in every way so girls of our city grow and prosper. It&rsquo;s something I love to do. The Boston community is a generous community, and we&rsquo;re fortunate to have Big Sister in Boston because we have a lot of generous donors. We have a community that wants to help.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Your last name &ldquo;Re&rdquo; &mdash; I assume that people think you&rsquo;re not done writing it half the time. </strong>That&rsquo;s true. Re means king in Italian. Most people think it&rsquo;s shortened. It&rsquo;s not. They think that I&rsquo;m not done writing my husband&rsquo;s last name.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Re-Reinhart ... I can see why you didn&rsquo;t hyphenate it. ... Who in history would you like to meet?</strong> Eleanor Roosevelt, because I&rsquo;d be curious in talking to her about how she made change, how she was able to lead when she really wasn&rsquo;t in a position to lead, although she was the first lady. I&rsquo;d be curious what she would think her greatest impact was, given where we are today.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>What do you do for fun?</strong> I dance. I like to be with my girlfriends. I travel. I&rsquo;ve visited Peru, Ecuador, Vietnam, France with my husband. We did a biking tour in Burgundy, 25 miles a day. That&rsquo;s another one of my passions.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Your book club just read &ldquo;Between the World and Me&rdquo; by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Isn&rsquo;t his outlook for humanity rather pessimistic? How do you reconcile that thinking with the optimism that has to be inherent in your work?</strong> Coates provides a personal and realistic view of what it&rsquo;s like to grow up black in the United States. Regardless of how bleak a picture Coates paints, we will always work to make the dream of social justice a reality. Through matching and supporting long-term relationships between Big and Little Sisters who may come from different backgrounds, we are fostering understanding among communities and cultures that leads to lasting change.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 20 2016 08:56:52 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"January, 22 2016 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Our CEO talks about her mentors, building community, and getting #Girls2Great","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"Boston Business Journal","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":451,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/print-edition/2016/01/22/women-of-influence-this-nonprofit-ceo-says-it.html","download":"","contentId":451,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 08:38:05 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Deborah Re Named to BBJ's ","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>This year you can spread peace, joy, and support for Greater Boston&#39;s girls with your holiday cards!

Boston empowers women and girls through a variety of gender-specific programs and opportunities. &nbsp;For 64 years, we have only served girls and are the largest mentoring organization in Greater Boston exclusively focused on the unique needs of women and girls. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>On a personal note</strong>, I&rsquo;ve been a mother as long as I have been on the board. &nbsp;When I first became a parent, it was just about survival. &nbsp;Although obvious, I never realized how much my actions and my words would shape my daughter. &nbsp;She watches me- how I dress, how I act, what I like to do. &nbsp;My daughter is 8 now. &nbsp;She loves to read, she is good at math, she has very good manners, and she has aspirations &ndash; albeit it changes every day from &ldquo;I want to be a doctor&rdquo; to &ldquo;I want to be a singer and dancer&rdquo; to &ldquo;I want to be a gymnast.&rdquo; &nbsp;She talks to me about her friends in school, who got in trouble in class, who got a &ldquo;red ticket&rdquo; (for good behavior) in class. &nbsp; She is able to talk to me. &nbsp;I am there for her not only as a mother but as a positive role model. &nbsp; I look at these girls whose parents want them to have a positive role model, a mentor because they don&rsquo;t have one for one reason or another. &nbsp;Big Sister Boston can provide this for these girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>What can you do? &nbsp;There are 350 girls currently waiting to be matched with a Big Sister</strong>. I ask that you (or your company) commit <strong>$2,000 </strong>to Big Sister for 2015. &nbsp;Your<strong> $2,000 </strong>can take 2 girls off the wait list.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meet one of them:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hi, I am Jael.

Below you&#39;ll find the annual cover letter, from chief executive officer Deborah Re.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dear Friends,<br />\r\nLast year, girls and women made the headlines. We applauded the selection of Malala Yousafzai as our Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and were concerned with the rise of campus violence against women. We were encouraged to learn that pay equity among women is increasing in many countries, and were enraged by the kidnapping of over 200 girls in Nigeria. Although we may not directly impact girls and women nationally or internationally, we do work together to create a stronger community for the girls in our region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many individuals and companies stepped up in 2014 to offer their support to us and provide opportunities for our Little Sisters. FleishmanHillard stood up and said, We will help you with your marketing efforts; Paul Revere Transportation said, We will provide transportation for your Little Sisters; professionals from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts said, We will help you develop a stronger support structure for your staff; the Boston Police Department said, We will train you in self-defense to help keep you safe; forty-four people from our community stepped up and said, We will provide winter coats for the girls waiting to be matched with a Big Sister; and, seven hundred women stood up and said, We will become Big Sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, as a member of our new Governor Charlie Baker&rsquo;s transition committee, I saw firsthand the deep commitment of our Governor to improve the quality of life and create access and opportunity for all<br />\r\nMassachusetts residents. Serving on Mayor Walsh&rsquo;s Women&rsquo;s Commission, it&rsquo;s clear to me that the welfare of girls and women is an essential part of his agenda to create a healthy, vibrant City.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important leader in sustaining a strong, connected City is the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce. Being recognized by the Chamber to receive their Pinnacle Award for Non-profit Management, demonstrates the value they place on the work that we are doing at Big Sister to improve the lives of girls, and women, in our region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we launch the New Year with National Mentoring Month, our mentors and Alumnae are preparing for a day of advocacy at the State House. We are fortunate to work in a City where so many individuals are &nbsp;committed to ensuring that Greater Boston is a place where girls and women can thrive. We know that when we all come together: government, corporate, private, and public, all citizens, focused not on our otherness but on our oneness, our community will only grow<br />\r\nstronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are grateful for the giving, compassionate spirit of the Big Sister community.

Dawnn was everything that was right about our city. She became a powerful agent for change thanks to the family and community that raised her in Boston. Her parents challenged her to succeed. She took part in positive, strong programs and pursued her studies earnestly. She went to college and excelled. Then she chose to return to give back. She served in the very programs that developed her own leadership and skills. She gave her heart in the same neighborhoods that were hers. And she taught the next generation of Dawnns what it was like to believe that you can do better and to know that you can, and will, succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, all this was taken from her and from us in the blink of an eye. This shining example of a new Boston was gunned down on our streets and lost forever. A few stray bullets, from a gun that was not sold back, from a person who did not think about our community, took Dawnn and all she meant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We put out this call for action and ownership, for ALL in this city to take responsibility for the violence that continues to plague the streets in OUR City. Unless and until we work to stop the violent death of black and brown young men and women in our neighborhoods, we should all accept that we are a part of the problem that begs for a solution. One might ask, why such outrage now? OUR response is very simple: we are tired of the violence and mad as hell! OUR anger coupled with OUR belief in the value of all of OUR City&rsquo;s young people, compels us to act.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we sit here and once more say, &ldquo;never again, never will there be another Dawnn,&rdquo; we know that these are meaningless words if there is no action. What happened to Dawnn is not normal, yet we have normalized city violence. We all must make a concerted and collective effort to stem the tide of violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While we know that a problem of this scope requires a thorough, systemic solution, we propose a few steps that we can ALL take immediately:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A. Own the Loss of Each Child: Imagine it as if it were your own child&mdash;because they are all OUR children. Every young person is a valuable asset. Let&rsquo;s push all of OUR young people towards life success.<br />\r\nB. Engage Your Community: Have dinner with your neighbors. Get to know everyone, even those guys on the corner you are afraid of&mdash;SAY HELLO.<br />\r\nC. Keep Your Doors Open, Later: Organizations serving our young people must extend their hours during the HOT times when we know OUR young people are most vulnerable to violent crime.<br />\r\nD. Recognize the Trauma and Barriers: Our communities face challenges that can be combated with resources&mdash;mental health support, substance abuse treatment, housing, jobs&mdash;they are all a priority.<br />\r\nE. Use Your Voice: Reward those who have the courage to speak out. Raise up the problem where there is one and address the problem first through community efforts, then when necessary, through law enforcement.<br />\r\nF. Use Your VOTE: Election season is upon us. Vote for those candidates who have moral courage and who recognize the barriers and trauma affecting our communities on a daily basis. Challenge and elect those who will utilize their voices and more importantly, their budgets to implement change NOW.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, get out there and do something today and every day to end the violence in OUR community and don&rsquo;t stop until it has stopped. Do something different, something more, something. It&rsquo;s not THEM or THEY that are dying, it is WE and US. And it will continue until we all change and understand that, from the brownstones of the Back Bay to the bricks of Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan, we all play a part in making Boston, OUR city, a world class city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Inaction is not an option.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Dawnn-Jaffer.jpg\" /></strong></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 14:40:41 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"September, 12 2014 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"With the hope that words do indeed become actions, please read the Lewis Family Foundation article published today in the Boston Globe, urging each of us to embrace peace and lead by example.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":431,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":431,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 08:33:18 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"A Letter to Our Community","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<h2>He sees need for men to step forth on domestic violence</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>IN REGARD to the article<a href=\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/09/09/what-next-for-ray-rice-ravens-and-nfl/qrlzITqys4TlSk0Mb3yi3N/story.html\" target=\"_blank\"> &ldquo;What&rsquo;s next for Ray Rice, the Ravens, and the NFL?&rdquo;</a> (Sports, Sept. 10), maybe the real question to ask is: What action will men take to prevent domestic violence and violence toward women?<br />\r\nViolence toward women occurs every day in our neighborhoods. Just recently, two of my female colleagues were assaulted. Violence does not consider socioeconomics, demographics, or geographic location; it simply does not discriminate.<br />\r\nMany female-centric organizations and advocacy groups exist to reach women and girls to prevent and break the cycle of violence, but where do men register on this issue?<br />\r\nWe as men, for whatever reason, have normalized this violence or have not cared enough to even be aware of the extent to which it occurs. As a male working at an organization that serves girls and women, I have become keenly aware of these issues and feel that all men can and must do more.<br />\r\nUntil men are willing to play a leading role in the battle to curtail violence toward women, our mothers, sisters, daughters, colleagues, friends, and partners will continue to fall victim. I urge all men to get involved by first getting informed.

But for some volunteers, taking on the responsibility of a mentor can be a big role to fill.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nVolunteers who think about becoming a mentor frequently ask themselves:<br />\r\nAm I qualified? Do I have the skills to become a mentor?<br />\r\nWhat&rsquo;s the time commitment?<br />\r\nWhat happens if my mentee asks a question I can&rsquo;t answer?<br />\r\nAddressing the issues that keep potential mentors from volunteering is important if nonprofit leaders are to successfully recruit, motivate, and retain long-term, valuable volunteers who feel empowered in their role as mentors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHere are three tips that tap into the key motivations of volunteers, and help them build a high-value, long-term mentor role:&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>1) Encourage volunteers to &lsquo;Be Yourself&rsquo; &ndash; tap into your own skills and personality.</strong><br />\r\nAt Big Sister Association of Greater Boston, we hear time and again from prospective volunteers that they do not feel qualified to become a mentor. While this concern is natural, it could not be farther from the truth.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMentors have the unique opportunity to stand out from teachers, tutors, parents and guardians by serving as an adult friend for their mentees. Yet, similar to the other roles, they are at the forefront of so many valuable teachable moments within the relationship. From the smallest interactions to valuable life lessons, mentees are learning from their mentors.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMentors do not need special skills or talents; they just need to be willing to listen, guide and offer encouragement.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs nonprofit organizations, we must alleviate this &ldquo;qualification&rdquo; concern by encouraging prospective volunteers to tap into their own skillsets and personalities to get the most out of their relationship with their mentees.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>2) Remind them that it&rsquo;s &lsquo;give and get&rsquo; &ndash; mentors are going to offer up a significant portion of their time, but not without reward.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnother significant fear for volunteers is the time commitment it takes to become a mentor. Frank and open conversations surrounding the required time commitment for a mentorship program is crucial before a volunteer starts.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhile the time commitment might sound daunting to some volunteers, they should be reminded that mentorship relationships are extremely rewarding as well.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen approaching the conversations surrounding time commitments, do not forget to drive home the value-add for prospective volunteers: what do volunteers stand to gain from joining your program? The women who volunteer for Big Sister often report that the program has helped them become their &ldquo;best self,&rdquo; and that the positive energy gained from their mentorship relationship has influenced how they interact with peers, in the workplace and at home. They enjoy the networking benefits of being a Big Sister, the many events and conference they attend as well as the training and support they receive.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEach nonprofit mentoring organization has a specific value add that should be clearly communicated to prospective employees upon interest.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>3) Remind volunteers that they are not alone. Make sure they understand the resources available to them if challenges arise.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBefore a volunteer gets started, mentoring organizations must ensure that volunteers understand the resources available to them if challenges arise in their relationship with their mentee.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMapping out the resources available to prospective volunteers and addressing boundaries help avoid larger issues from the outset.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOrganizations should provide training materials and resources, and provide a clear protocol should volunteers need guidance and advice. Volunteers should also know their boundaries &ndash; what issues should they tackle and which they should be sharing with support staff.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 14:36:17 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"September, 10 2014 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Big Sister CEO Deborah Re provides expert advice on volunteers and mentoring.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"Mass Nonprofit News","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":430,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"http://massnonprofit.org/expert.php?artid=3816&catid=83","download":"","contentId":430,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 19 2016 14:36:17 +0000","systemName":"","image":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/MNN-Report.jpg","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Tips for Transforming Volunteers into High-Value Mentors","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>For Immediate Release<br />\r\nJune 11, 2014<br />\r\nReleased By: Office of Women&#39;s Advancement &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nBostonWomen@cityofboston.gov</p>\r\n\r\n<p>BOSTON &ndash;Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the creation of the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement, a department which will oversee and coordinate the Mayor&rsquo;s initiatives to promote equal rights and equal economic, social, political and educational opportunities for all women and girls throughout Boston. In addition, Mayor Walsh announced the revitalization of the <a href=\"http://www.cityofboston.gov/women/commission/\" target=\"_blank\">Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission</a>, which will advise the Mayor on issues pertaining to women in Boston and work closely with the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement to fulfill its mission of attaining full equity for women in all areas of life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I am thrilled to have the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement and the Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission in place to help make Boston America&rsquo;s premier city for women. I strongly believe that when women succeed, Boston succeeds,&rdquo; said Mayor Walsh. &ldquo;I am particularly excited to have such a diverse and experienced Women&rsquo;s Commission to work with me on this important issue. The equal treatment of the people of Boston impacts all of us - women and men alike - and with the new Commission, we are bringing all these voices to the table.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The work of the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement will focus on three key areas: understanding and reporting on the status of women and girls in Boston through data and research; advancing women&rsquo;s economic equity in partnership with the Boston Women&rsquo;s Workforce Council; and promoting women&rsquo;s health and safety. The department will be housed in the Health and Human Services cabinet. The Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission will support this work by providing a permanent, effective voice for women across Boston, and by collaborating with public, private, and non-profit partners on key issue areas significantly affecting women and girls.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Megan Costello will serve as the Executive Director of the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement, as well as the Chair of the Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Women make up 52 percent of Boston&rsquo;s population, so there is a social and economic need to ensure equal opportunities for women in the City,&rdquo; said Costello. &ldquo;For the first time in nearly 20 years, we now have an appointed Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission that will help make women equal participants in Boston&rsquo;s economy and civil society. And with the Mayor&rsquo;s Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement, we now have a vehicle for tangible policy change.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The diverse Boston Women&rsquo;s Commission is comprised of female and male leaders in business, academia, the non-profit sector, and civil society.

Ed Walsh &mdash; not just as firefighters but as men.<br />\r\n&ldquo;It all makes me want to be a better person,&rdquo; she said.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThat&rsquo;s a fitting epitaph for Michael Kennedy as the 33-year-old firefighter was laid to rest yesterday.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAn inspiration to do better may be the lasting legacies of both fallen firefighters.<br />\r\nWearing the blazer, slacks and tie Kennedy&rsquo;s mother, Kathy, bought him Monday, a somber-faced Alex Beauzile walked slowly down the center aisle of Holy Name Church yesterday to present the gifts at the altar for the man he loved, and who loved him back.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFor seven years Kennedy was a &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; to Alex, who&rsquo;s 14 now and lives in Milton. &ldquo;Alex and Mike together were like Disney World,&rdquo; said Alex&rsquo;s mother, Genie, after the funeral. &ldquo;We weren&rsquo;t related as blood but he made it seem like that. He gave Alex things I couldn&rsquo;t as a single mother.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPlaying video games and pickup basketball, snowboarding, watching sports, going to Celtics games and Six Flags in Agawam. Once, when Alex got in trouble, Kennedy applied a little tough love: He had Alex fill buckets with rocks as Kennedy landscaped in his backyard. &ldquo;It showed me that what I did was wrong,&rdquo; Alex told the Herald two days after Kennedy was killed. &ldquo;The next time I just calmed down.&rdquo;<br />\r\nAlex&rsquo;s mother said yesterday, &ldquo;At the wake and funeral I kept hearing about &lsquo;the rocks, the rocks.&rsquo; I&rsquo;m like, wow, this man let everybody know about Alex. As a mother it&rsquo;s an honor to feel such love and understanding. That even through hard times, everything is going to be all right because the light has to shine.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd shine the light has. Since the story of Alex and Michael Kennedy made the news, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been an amazing response from Michael&rsquo;s friends and firefighters wanting to become big brothers,&rdquo; said Nora Leary of Big Brothers and Big Sisters of Massachusetts. It&rsquo;s also come from regular Joes and Janes, said Deborah Re, of Big Sisters of Greater Boston.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe waiting list is still very long, Re said. Eight hundred boys between 7 and 12 are waiting for mentors, as are 350 girls between 8 and 15. But Re said they&rsquo;ve just found a possible match for Alex&rsquo;s sister Gabby, 13. Leary said the Big Brothers are planning to meet with Alex and his mother when the time is right to see if he wants another big brother.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLosing Kennedy, Alex&rsquo;s mother said yesterday, has been hard for her son.<br />\r\n&ldquo;He used to tell me, &lsquo;When I get to certain age, mommy, I&rsquo;m gonna move to Mike&rsquo;s house,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That will not happen now, he understands. But the memories will last forever.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFirefighter Michael R. Kennedy, she said, &ldquo;was the best gift my son ever had.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Erin Smith contributed to this report.</em></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 13:56:18 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"April, 04 2014 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Boston Herald reports: There are 800 boys and 350 girls waiting for mentors in Boston.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"Boston Herald","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":422,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"http://www.bostonherald.com/news_opinion/columnists/margery_eagan/2014/04/eagan_a_bond_of_big_brothers","download":"","contentId":422,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 08:33:55 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Boston Herald: Bond of Brothers","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Wall-Street-Journal-Logo.jpg\" style=\"line-height:20.8px\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FleishmanHillard to Support Big Sister Association of Greater Boston</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>FleishmanHillard announced today a yearlong commitment for its Boston office to provide pro bono communications strategy, public relations and social media services on behalf of Big Sister Association of Greater Boston.WSJ article on Big Sister</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/FleishmanHillard-Wall-Street-Journal.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />&quot;We&#39;re proud to support Big Sister Association of Greater Boston -- a pillar in the Boston community for more than 60 years,&quot; said Danielle Wuschke, general manager of FleishmanHillard&#39;s Boston office. &quot;Working collaboratively with the local Big Sister organization, we will focus on amplifying awareness of their program with important community stakeholders, partners and donors.

As a girl, she wanted to be like her female cousins: popular and successful. She understood by osmosis that she would pursue an education. Her family made that abundantly clear.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBut for many Latino families, the role modeling ends with relatives. The notion of taking steps to help a young person outside of the extended family may seem strange, almost unnatural. That&rsquo;s one of the reasons why there&rsquo;s a lack of volunteers to mentor the 500 girls, most of them of color, on the waiting list of Big Sister Association of Greater Boston. That&rsquo;s also why Rom&aacute;n&rsquo;s decision to reach outside the family circle to help young girls in need of role models is so noteworthy.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nRom&aacute;n, 41, is a strong-minded and lively Latina whose passion and energy is impossible not to rub off. She got involved with the Big Sister Association of Greater Boston after building her career as a lawyer a decade ago. She was quickly matched with a South Boston girl named Migleila, then just 7 years old and of Puerto Rican descent as well. She&rsquo;s now 16, and thanks to Rom&aacute;n, sees the world through more than one lens. About once a month they cook together in Rom&aacute;n&rsquo;s Wellesley home, or visit a Latin restaurant, or go to the MFA. They often take Migleila&rsquo;s older sister Elizabeth on their outings.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFun stuff, but the magic of being a powerful role model happens on a deeper level. For Rom&aacute;n, who is also a licensed psychologist, the moment came when it became clear the message about education was sinking in. &ldquo;At some point, Migleila was completely against college. But that&rsquo;s what they hear in their surroundings. They hear it makes no sense,&rdquo; Rom&aacute;n says. &ldquo;But I kept drilling, I would say to her: You can study whatever you want, it&rsquo;s not like high school, it&rsquo;s a great experience, you can have a better life and make a difference.&rdquo; Eventually, says Rom&aacute;n, both Migleila and Elizabeth were repeating what she was saying.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;They did end up listening to me! It took me a while, at least a year, to convince them,&rdquo; she says proudly.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEven though her exceptional volunteer efforts have been good news for Migleila and her family, there are not enough Eneida Romans to go around. While any dedicated mentor is welcome, there&rsquo;s a particular lack of Big Sisters of color. Just 5 percent of the approximately 2,400 Boston-area volunteers are Latina. Of the 2,800 girls served by the organization through all of its programs, 35 percent are black and 30 percent Latina.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Big Sister Association in Boston is trying to do something about this gap, and to that end Rom&aacute;n was asked to join the organization&rsquo;s four-year-old Diversity Council. She also serves on the National Hispanic Advisory Council of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Hispanic families often don&rsquo;t want to send their kids to these programs because they don&rsquo;t trust the people involved, they don&rsquo;t see it as natural,&rdquo; Rom&aacute;n tells me, switching effortlessly between English and Spanish. &ldquo;But you and I understand the culture, we can capture nuances automatically. I know that Migleila&rsquo;s mother tells me things and talks to me about certain things because I&rsquo;m Latina and I get her.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThat, says Rom&aacute;n, is bad news for kids on the margin, kids who could benefit from the Eneida Rom&aacute;ns of the world.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;My concern is that, if we don&rsquo;t have mentoring in place for a lot of Hispanics, without those role models, without these mentoring programs in place and without these tools to help Hispanics achieve their maximum potential, i.e., education, we&rsquo;re going to be a community of marginalized and poor people. We don&rsquo;t want that. The potential is there.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd part of sensing the potential is seeing people like you be successful. &ldquo;I know Migleila&rsquo;s self-esteem has flourished after seeing me and my friends,&rdquo; says Rom&aacute;n. &ldquo;She and her sister have met some of my friends, and they are people who look like them and are successful women, so that has impacted their life as well. Being with me, they see beyond the communities that they live in. They see professional woman, and they say, I can be like them.&rdquo;<br />\r\nMigleila aspires to own a fancy Newbury Street salon. &ldquo;I always tell her, &lsquo;Well, you have to study business first.&rsquo; And I tell her I&rsquo;ll be her first client, but she has to go to college first,&rdquo; she says smiling, but dead serious.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Marcela Garc&iacute;a is a special correspondent at Telemundo Boston and a contributor to the Boston Business Journal.</em></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 13:17:34 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"July, 23 2013 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Globe writer, Marcela Garcia, writes an opinion piece about the need for women of color to become Big Sisters.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"Boston Globe","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":411,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/07/21/needed-latinas-help-change-lives/vb8RgVgGVntvyck6Ufma7I/story.html","download":"","contentId":411,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 08:35:44 +0000","systemName":"","image":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Boston-Globe-Op-Ed-7-22-2013.jpg","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Boston-Globe-Op-Ed-7-22-2013.jpg?w702-h702-x39-y19","author":"","title":"Boston Globe, Op-Ed July 22","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Boston-Herald-Logo.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>June 20: Letter To the Editor</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Help girls help selves</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It was encouraging to read the Rev.

More than 130 guests were in attendance to sample the creations of Boston&rsquo;s most talented chefs. Michael Schlow, celebrated chef and long-time supporter of Big Sister, hosted the event in his fun and modern Financial District-based restaurant, which is set to close its doors at the end of the month. &ldquo;Although it is bittersweet that this event will be the last time at Radius, it will not be the last time partnering with Big Sister. We love our kinship with Big Sister,&rdquo; said Schlow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chef<strong> Ting Yen (Oishii)</strong> started the dinner off with a raw wild king salmon, which was highlighted with a truffle explosion and scallion. <strong>Jeremy Sewall (Eastern Standard, Lineage, Island Creek Oyster Bar)</strong> provided the second course: chilled York Harbor lobster salad with artichoke, petite radish, and caviar. The third course came courtesy of <strong>Evan Deluty (Stella)</strong>, who served a hearty potato gnocchi with peas, pancetta, and peccorino. The next dish was black bass with wild mushrooms, broccoli miso puree, and tempura bits, expertly prepared by Michael Schlow himself. &nbsp;<strong>Ming Tsai (Blue Ginger)</strong> served the fifth course, which was a five-spiced rump roast atop a toasted garlic potato cake, with long beans and b-1 sauce. Radius&rsquo; own<strong> PJ Waters </strong>completed the meal with an interactive chocolate dessert, which included a cone of melted chocolate that guests used to playfully write on their own plates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a welcome from <strong>Little Sister Daneijah</strong>, a 12 year-old aspiring chef who helped prepare the evening&rsquo;s first course, guests heard from CEO Deborah Re about Big Sister Association&rsquo;s role in the mentoring relationships and how guests can support our work. &ldquo;A year ago, Daneijah&rsquo;s dream came true when she was matched with her Big Sister Alice. Tonight, we can help make even more girls realize their dreams.&rdquo; Together, attendees donated $37,000 during our annual &ldquo;Matchmaker Challenge&rdquo; appeal, sponsoring 37 girls on the wait list. During dessert, Chef Michael Schlow surprised guests with an impromptu live auction. The lucky winners took home two fantastic prizes: dinner for two at each of the 12 restaurants owned by the participating chefs, and four tickets to Radius&rsquo; exclusive Alumni Dinner on June 13th. Altogether the event raised <strong>$151,000.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the evening&rsquo;s highlights came at &nbsp;the close of the festivities. <strong>Board Member and long-time supporter John Yozell</strong> gave Chef Schlow a special gift: a chef&rsquo;s coat, signed by one of Schlow&rsquo;s inspirations, Julia Child. Touched by the gift, Chef Schlow immediately returned the favor, giving John a new chef&rsquo;s coat, signed by the evening&rsquo;s celebrity chefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would like to thank <strong>Chef Michael Schlow</strong> and the celebrity chefs for an amazing dinner.

The Report celebrates Big Sister&rsquo;s accomplishments from the previous year, presented in the style of a teenage magazine, which reflects the vibrancy, boldness, and energy of our Little Sisters. Featured on the cover are<strong> Big Sister Ana Leon</strong> and <strong>Little Sister Sally</strong>. Ana, who told the crowd that she has been matched with Sally for seven years, was recently named 2013 Massachusetts Big Sister of the Year. Through stories like Ana and Sally&rsquo;s, quotes from women we admire, including many of our Big Sisters, horoscopes, book reviews, and words from our community partners, readers will learn about the impact an investment in Big Sister Association, and a Big Sister mentor can have on the life of a young girl.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe also celebrated the achievements of two staff members who embody the values and beliefs of Big Sister and do whatever it takes to ensure girls reach their full potential. <strong>Annie Fischer</strong>, Coordinator of Match Support, was recognized with the <strong>Above and Beyond Award</strong>. Not only does Annie exceed her goals, she also works collaboratively with other departments, actively seeks fund development opportunities for the organization, and continually leverages all the strengths of our organization to benefit the girls we serve. Annie&rsquo;s warmth, sense of humor, positive attitude and enthusiasm for her work are invaluable to the organization. <strong>Heidi Ziobro</strong>, Vice President of Programs, was recognized with the <strong>Excellence in Management Award </strong>for her leadership of all our programs in 2012. To put it simply, Heidi gets things done. Her straightforward communication and &ldquo;say what you mean and mean what you say&rdquo; attitude make her an extremely successful leader. Heidi is involved and approachable to staff at all levels of the organization.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Sharon McNally</strong>, President of the Board of Directors, closed the program with a few words about the past year. She recalled telling the crowd at last year&rsquo;s Annual Meeting that Big Sister should celebrate our accomplishments and &ldquo;show-off&rdquo; all the wonderful work we do for the girls of our community. &nbsp;She commented, &ldquo;In 2012, we did just that and more.

I thought there would certainly be other women who looked like me.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mayfield&rsquo;s experience is typical at the Big Sister Association of Greater Boston: While 85 percent of the girls served by the mentorship program are black, Latina, Asian, or Native American, only about one-third of the mentoring volunteers are nonwhite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, the Big Sister Association and Boston City Councilor Ayanna Pressley are trying to change those demographics. In 2009, the organization established a Diversity Council, tasked with finding new ways to connect with communities of color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Months later, Pressley launched Ayanna&rsquo;s Big Challenge - a campaign to recruit black, Latino, Asian, and Native-American Bostonians as mentors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Many mentor-mentee pairings are not perfectly homogenous, and I know that young people are still benefiting,&rsquo;&rsquo; says Pressley, who is a Big Sister herself. &ldquo;But certainly there is the potential for that impact to be maximized when there is that instant cultural connection and relatability.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, the efforts appear to be working: Between August 2009 and December 2011, the share of minority mentors at Big Sister grew from 26 to 32 percent. Mia Roberts, the organization&rsquo;s vice president of recruitment and community partnerships, says families often request a mentor who shares their ethnic background, speaks their home language, or lives in their same neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Many of these parents are looking for someone who can have fun with their daughters, but they&rsquo;re also asking for a woman of a similar cultural background to help them navigate the culture in which these girls are raised,&rsquo;&rsquo; Roberts says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressley&rsquo;s own Little Sister is a Mattapan teenager named Arianna who, like, Pressley, is African-American and grew up in a single-parent household.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The relationship is much more than a &ldquo;a cutesy idea about taking a kid out to ice cream now and then,&rsquo;&rsquo; says Pressley. In addition to weekly hang-outs, they text daily to talk about an exam, a new boyfriend, or just to check in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pressley believes many women of color assume they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;mentor material.&rsquo;&rsquo; She recalls meeting one black woman, a hairstylist, who was concerned about whether she could make the cut. &ldquo;In her mind, she felt there was a very specific sort of profile that makes someone fit to be a mentor . . .; a very specific kind of a professional, a lawyer or someone with a PhD,&rsquo;&rsquo; Pressley explains. &ldquo;I told her, &lsquo;You are appropriate, and you are worthy, and you are good enough.&rsquo; &rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With about 150 girls currently on the waiting list for a mentor, the Big Sister Association can&rsquo;t give every girl a mentor with a similar background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Pressley envisions a time when all girls in the Big Sister program can be matched with someone who shares a cultural experience beyond race: For example, girls could be paired with someone who knows what it&rsquo;s like to have a parent in prison, Pressley says, or who identifies as lesbian, bisexual, or transgender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Julia Collao, who has been a mentor to 14-year-old Willina for three months, says a shared cultural background and language have helped her connect with her Little Sister&rsquo;s family. Collao is Peruvian-American, and Willina&rsquo;s parents are from the Dominican Republic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was very comfortable very fast,&rsquo;&rsquo; says Collao, 23. &ldquo;Her mom welcomed me right into the family. Being able to speak the language really does help.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After her orientation session, Mayfield expected to be paired with an African-American girl. To her surprise, she ended up with 11-year-old Natalie - who is Latina - an altogether different kind of cross-cultural exchange.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I know what it&rsquo;s like to be a woman of color and to have people look at you and have certain expectations,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mayfield says. &ldquo;But at the same time, I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to be from a family of immigrants.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the two get together, they discuss things like Natalie&rsquo;s plans for choosing a high school, the goings-on in her large family, and the Katniss-Peeta romance in &ldquo;The Hunger Games.&rsquo;&rsquo; Most of all, Mayfield says, she serves as a friend to Natalie - and for that, she says, sharing a cultural background doesn&rsquo;t much matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;With three older siblings, there&rsquo;s not a lot of things that are hers,&rsquo;&rsquo; Mayfield says. &ldquo;But for all intents and purposes, I am hers - and I&rsquo;m really proud of that.&rsquo;&rsquo;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19

&nbsp;Everyone enjoyed libations provided by <strong>Sam Adams</strong>, <strong>Berkshire Mountain Distillers</strong>, and <strong>RIPE Bar Juice </strong>and cooled off with trips to the raffle and silent auction tables. &nbsp;Lucky winners went home with gift certificates to Boston&rsquo;s hottest restaurants, Aerosmith tickets, a private vineyard tour and tasting, Red Sox and BC Football tickets, a Nantucket getaway, and more! &nbsp;To commemorate the evening, groups of friends donned 80&rsquo;s gear, packed into a photo booth, and took home pictures complements of <strong>Photo Fun Box</strong>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nYoung Professional Board member, Jamie Charles, rounded out the evening by sharing a friend&rsquo;s story. &nbsp;&ldquo;My friend, a Big Sister, asked her Little Sister if she could do more for her than visiting and taking her out each week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Her Little explained that, though she may feel like spending time with her is not enough, it means the world to her and is exactly what she needs.&rdquo; &nbsp;He closed by explaining to the crowd the importance of giving each girl the opportunity to have a supportive, caring role model in her life.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSpecial thanks to Urban Block Party sponsors <strong><a href=\"http://www.boston.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Boston.com</a>, eSec Lending, Patrick Carney Foundation,

It is clear from the bright yellow cover to the &ldquo;movie&rdquo; advertisement on the back page that the theme of this year&rsquo;s report is a teenage magazine, which reflects the vibrancy, boldness, and energy of our Little Sisters. We had fun filling the pages with letters from our Little Sisters, horoscopes, advertisements, and interviews with our matches. Through this content, readers will learn about the impact a Big Sister mentor can have on the life of a young girl. Said Board President Sharon McNally, &ldquo;These girls have faced challenges. But the relationship they have with a Big Sister has given them the strength to believe in themselves, the courage to explore life&rsquo;s options, and the confidence to be successful.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBelow is a slideshow that we presented at our Annual Meeting, which highlights different events and achievements from throughout 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/bigsister12/2012-annual-meeting-slideshow\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>2012 Annual Meeting Slideshow</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/qtk6h4nveZLSvz\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div><strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/bigsister12/2012-annual-meeting-slideshow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"2012 Annual Meeting Slideshow\">2012 Annual Meeting Slideshow</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/bigsister12\" target=\"_blank\">bigsister12</a></strong></div>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 12:33:49 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"May, 14 2012 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":397,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":397,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:09:07 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2011-Annual-Report.jpg?w400-h400-x0-y0","author":"","title":"New Board President Sharon McNally","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>On May 5th 2012, eight Little Sisters (along with their Big Sisters) participated in <a href=\"https://boston.lemonadeday.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Lemonade Day</a>, a national event that inspires children to learn how to operate their own small business by setting up a lemonade stand.

Following the video, <strong>Big Sister CEO Deborah Re</strong> took the stage to introduce Bank of America&rsquo;s Global Strategy and Marketing Executive and Northeast President, <strong>Anne Finucane</strong>. In her remarks, Ms. Finucane explained that her life did not follow the path that she had originally intended, yet she was still able to attain the important position that she holds today. Some of this success she attributes to the support of two caring and inspirational mentors. Ms. Finucane went on to describe Bank of America&rsquo;s work with Vital Voices Global Partnership, an international organization dedicated to mentoring emerging women leaders in developing countries around the world. Through Bank of America&rsquo;s partnership with Vital Voices, women receive guidance from established leaders so that they can realize their potential, which helps them to make a bigger difference in their country while strengthening economies at the same time. Whether you are mentoring a girl in Boston, Massachusetts or Port-au-Prince, Haiti, you have an opportunity not only to change that one person&rsquo;s life, but to transform entire communities. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nBoston City Councilor At-Large and Big Sister <strong>Ayanna Pressley </strong>continued the inspiring morning by sharing her own story. She said that she understood the importance of mentoring not because she had a supportive mentor when she was a child, but because she didn&rsquo;t. She recognizes that she could have benefitted immensely by having an adult in her life in addition to her mother whom she could talk to, trust, and rely on. So that another girl could receive the kind of support that she herself had not, Councilor Pressley volunteered to become a Big Sister. Her Little Sister Arianna turned out to be her perfect match &mdash; their names are similar, their birthdays are two days apart, and they simply enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. As a testament to the depth of their relationship, Councilor Pressley said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not an elected official who happens to be a Big Sister. I&rsquo;m a Big Sister who happens to be an elected official.&rdquo; She went on to enforce the importance of mentoring, explaining that when you inspire a girl, you really can transform a community. &ldquo;Girls rock, and women rule,&rdquo; she concluded.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEvent co-chairs and board members<strong> Kerry Nelson </strong>and <strong>Maria Fernandes</strong> took the stage and told the audience that for just $1,000 Big Sister can make and support a mentoring match for a full year. The crowd responded by generously giving more than $61,000 to help Big Sister further our mission.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe thank the Big Sister community of supporters for helping to make Rise &amp; Inspire a success. We hope that everyone will be inspired to rise with us again for next year&rsquo;s annual breakfast.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 11:55:52 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"March, 23 2012 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":392,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":392,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:10:14 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Anne-and-Ayanna.jpg?w166-h166-x43-y0","author":"","title":"Anne Finucane & Ayanna Pressley Inspire","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Nat-Conference-on-Girls-Education-Logo.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On February 10-12, Big Sister CEO Deborah Re attended the National Conference on Girls&#39; Education in Washington D.C., along with Big Sister staff members Sharon Daura and Diane Zipoli. This inaugural conference was a national gathering of professionals committed to the healthy development of girls. Over 400 educators from 25 states and six countries were in attendance. It was three full days of thought-provoking workshops and keynotes on everything from the brain development of girls in their various stages of development&mdash;windows of neurosensitivity&mdash;to how to help teenage girls manage themselves to become direct, straightforward leaders. Every workshop was eye-opening and provided ideas on how we can further enhance our own learning and support our matches at Big Sister.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBig Sister played an integral role in the success of this conference. In addition to being one of the lead sponsors, Deb served on the Advisory Council responsible for creating the framework for the conference, and Diane served on the Planning Committee, securing speakers and organizing the workshops. Additionally, Deb, Diane, and Sharon led a workshop titled &ldquo;Surviving and Thriving in a Coed World,&rdquo; which focused on how Big Sister&rsquo;s gender specific focus allows us to be responsive and innovative in our programming. The workshop also addressed some of the challenges that Big Sister faces as a girl-serving organization in a world that is increasingly geared to a co-ed framework.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 11:44:44 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"March, 05 2012 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":391,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":391,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:10:23 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Nat-Conference-on-Girls-Education-Logo.jpg?w205-h205-x43-y0","author":"","title":"National Conference on Girls' Education","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Thank you to our Big Sisters and Little Sisters, Host Committee, Board of Directors, and Boston&rsquo;s corporate, community, and philanthropic leaders for a night to remember.

This year, they expanded their annual &ldquo;Be the Change&rdquo; Award (sponsored by Canyon Ranch) to honor three Massachusetts non-profit organizations whose missions align with the conference &mdash; helping women and girls achieve their full potential, and exemplifying compassion and commitment to improving the lives of the people in their communities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;We are honored that the Massachusetts Conference for Women has selected us to receive this award,&rdquo; said Deborah Re. &ldquo;It is a special recognition as we end our 60th year of mentoring girls in Greater Boston.

Quite often, girls who first experience the program as Little Sisters grow up to become mentors themselves. When Little Sister Cassandra was notified that she would be graduating from the program, her immediate response was, &ldquo;How do I become a Big Sister?&rdquo; &nbsp;Cassandra&rsquo;s Big Sister Sarah had been an important and consistent part of her life for twelve years, and she wanted to do the same for another girl. Through Big Sister, Cassandra was motivated to give back to her community and make a difference in another young girl&rsquo;s life.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nYou can give a $5 gift in honor of Big Sister&rsquo;s &ldquo;Be the Change&rdquo; award now by texting 27722 with keyword: MAWOMEN Sisters<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBig Sister is a proud partner of the Massachusetts Conference for Women.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 10:43:35 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"December, 28 2011 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":387,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":387,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 19 2016 10:43:35 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"'Be the Change' Award for Big Sister","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><a href=\"http://www.necn.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Watch this at NECN</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nDeborah Re, CEO of the Big Sister Association of Greater Boston, talks about the agency&#39;s 60 years of mentoring.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 19 2016 10:42:26 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 23 2011 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"NECN","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":386,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"http://www.necn.com/","download":"","contentId":386,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 19 2016 10:42:37 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Video: CEO Deborah Re on NECN","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>CEO Deborah Re speaks on WBZ-TV&#39;s What&#39;s in Our Community</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1951, Big Sister Association of Greater Boston has been helping girls reach their full potential through positive mentoring relationships with women.

They are on corporate boards, they are leading major institutions, they are in the Senate and they have become secretaries of State.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSo does a T-shirt that says &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too pretty to do my homework so I&rsquo;ll have my brother do it&rdquo; really have an impact on girls&rsquo; chances for achieving success?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nYou bet it does. For every statistic about girls succeeding, there is another that shows the negative impact of marketing messages leading to lower levels of self-esteem, higher rates of depression, risky behaviors and poor life choices. When girls are taught to value their appearance to such an extreme without a responsible adult in their lives who can counter these messages, their opportunities will be compromised.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nJCPenney pulled this T-shirt from the company&rsquo;s Web site on Aug. 31 with the following statement: &ldquo;JCPenney is committed to being America&rsquo;s destination for great style and great value for the whole family. We agree that the &lsquo;Too pretty T-shirt&rsquo; does not deliver an appropriate message, and we have immediately discontinued its sale.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHow did the shirt make it to the online shelf in the first place? Weren&rsquo;t there men on their creative team who have daughters and know the impact of messages like these? Weren&rsquo;t there women on the team who can look back on being an adolescent remembering the insecurity of trying to fit in? This shirt was being marketed to adolescent girls at a pivotal time in their development, a time when they begin to internalize messages about what it means to be a girl. The implied message that doing homework &mdash; i.e. acquiring knowledge and thinking critically &mdash; is not feminine.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI caught enough of a radio talk show discussion of the subject to know that there are many adults, including the hosts of the show, who think that messages like this one are inconsequential. The callers and hosts overwhelmingly agreed that people are simply overreacting to a harmless and trivial T-shirt. A mother called in and said that she would buy the T-shirt for her 12-year-old daughter; another caller said that it was ridiculous that people were upset, and that he wore a T-shirt in college that said &ldquo;Got a sister?&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe point they are missing is that they, as adults, have context for these messages to help them process the information and dismiss them as absurd. A young girl does not have that context.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs a community of adults that supports the healthy development of children, we are responsible for reinforcing positive, empowering and constructive messages.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe want girls to know that their appearance is not their most valuable asset.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe do not want our daughters to think that they need to look a certain way or dress a certain way to be accepted.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe want them to know that being pretty and being smart are not mutually exclusive. And, given all the challenges confronting our educational system, why risk sending a message to girls, and boys as well, that doing homework is not important?<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Too-Pretty-Shirt.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><em>&ldquo;Who would wear a T-shirt that says they are stupid?&rdquo;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I thought about this issue I decided to solicit the opinion of the T-shirt&rsquo;s target demographic.

In a special audio recording, attendees heard from one of the matches featured in the Annual Report,<strong> Little Sister Zaire</strong> and <strong>Big Sister Katie.</strong> Zaire, a fifth grader from the Josiah Quincy Elementary School, described how her Big Sister Katie has helped her discover that she is good at math and how to deal constructively with her feelings of anger and frustration. Likewise, Zaire is teaching Katie the importance of making time for the things that are important in life, the things that are more &quot;heartfelt.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Zaire-and-Katie.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"color:#FF0000\"><strong>Click here to listen to Little Sister Zaire and Big Sister Katie.</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chief Executive Officer<strong> Deborah Re</strong> stressed how Zaire and Katie&rsquo;s story reveals the core of Big Sister&rsquo;s work: how a caring and supportive mentor can help a girl develop the confidence she needs to reach her full potential. Re also noted that &ldquo;it takes a village&rdquo; and that we could not bring our services to girls, year after year, without the support of our many community partners. She highlighted the strong partnerships Big Sister has nurtured in the community noting our relationship with the Mayor&rsquo;s Office and the Boston Public School system, our collaboration with other non-profits such as <strong>Boston Center for Youth and Families</strong> and <strong>Foundation to be Named Later</strong> and our connections with local businesses and business leaders such as <strong>b.good</strong> and <strong>Ann Flannery, </strong>of <strong>Legal Sea Foods.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nThe evening closed with a reminder that despite our many accomplishments, much work remains to be done. There are many girls throughout Greater Boston who would benefit from the guidance of a positive mentor. In 2011, Big Sister Association aims to serve 2900 girls in our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"485\" src=\"//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/sN4f1YswGeQs9D\" width=\"595\"></iframe></p>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/bigsisterboston/big-sister-2011-annual-meeting-7913317\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Big Sister 2011 Annual Meeting\">Big Sister 2011 Annual Meeting</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"//www.slideshare.net/bigsisterboston\" target=\"_blank\">Big Sister Association of Greater Boston</a></strong></div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/bigsisterboston/big-sister-2011-annual-meeting-7913317?qid=68d18fca-f4d7-4906-bcfb-750a7b95a5d3&amp;v=&amp;b=&amp;from_search=1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>View the Annual Meeting Slideshow Presentation.</strong></a></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 18 2016 12:26:11 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"May, 11 2011 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Maria Fernandes of Children’s Hospital Boston and Sue Hoffman of BJ’s Wholesale Club join Big Sister's Board of Directors.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":382,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"//bigsister.files.stage4.getfused.com/file/2010-BS-Annual-Report.pdf","contentId":382,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 08:46:29 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Our-History-is-Her-Future.jpg?w248-h248-x252-y33","author":"","title":"Big Sister Announces New Board Members at Annual Meeting","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>he ambience was bright and lively as old and new friends gathered at <strong>Radius </strong>for Big Sister&rsquo;s twelfth annual <strong>Celebrity Chef Dinner </strong>on Sunday April 10. 120 guests gathered to support Big Sister and to sample the culinary delights of 6 of Boston&rsquo;s most talented chefs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><br />\r\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Radius1.jpg\" style=\"line-height:20.8px; text-align:center\" /><br />\r\n<em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Former Little Sister Jesse Kwan, Big Sister CEO<br />\r\nDeborah Re,</span></em><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">&nbsp;Former Big Sister Executive Director<br />\r\nJeanne Yozell.

Mrs. Patrick spoke to the challenges facing girls today and how quickly they can head down an unhealthy path if they don&#39;t see a future for themselves. &quot;Being a Big Sister means plucking the threads of character from a girl and weaving a carpet that she can use to fly.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nGuest speaker, <strong>Linda Brennan</strong>, a former Little Sister who grew up in the Bromley-Heath housing development, reinforced Mrs. Patrick&#39;s words as she shared the life-changing impact of having a Big Sister. Linda&#39;s parents were poor, uneducated, and physically ill, leaving them often unable to provide their daughter with the care and attention she needed. Linda didn&#39;t dream beyond what she saw around her. When she was matched with her <strong>Big Sister Marlene</strong>, Linda was unsure a woman she had never met would even show up to the housing development in which she lived. But she did. And for more than 40 years, she has remained by Linda&#39;s side: Through dolls and dating, high school graduation and college applications.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen the demands of nursing her ailing father, working two jobs, and commuting to school every day became too much Linda considered leaving college. Marlene put forth a simple challenge: &quot;If you tell me you do not want to do this anymore, I will understand. &nbsp;But please don&#39;t tell me you cannot do this.&quot; &nbsp;Linda went on to graduate from college, earn her master&#39;s degree, buy a home, start a family, and see both her children graduate from college. Then, in 2008, Linda was diagnosed with breast cancer. As always, Marlene provided love and support through Linda&#39;s recovery. On February 17, Marlene was once again there for her Little Sister, sitting proudly by the stage as Linda shared her story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/60th-Anniversary-1.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Deborah Re, Big Sister&#39;s CEO,<br />\r\nand members of the Big Sister<br />\r\ncommunity share their hopes for girls</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><em><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/60th-Anniversary-2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" /></em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><em>Diane Patrick, First Lady of<br />\r\nMassachusetts,with Little Sister Kenya,<br />\r\nwho currentlylives in Bromley-Heath,<br />\r\nand former Little Sister Linda who also grew up there&nbsp;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/60th-Anniversary-3.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" /></span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Linda&#39;s daughter, Jacqueline, and<br />\r\nher former Big Sister Marlene Archer</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/60th-Anniversary-4.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" /></span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Big Sister&#39;s Board Chair, Timothy<br />\r\nO&#39;Brien, and former interim ED,<br />\r\nChristine Creelman, show their<br />\r\nsupport for the future of girls</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Photos: Yuri George Vaysgant <a href=\"http://yurivaysgant.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.yurivaysgant.com</a></span></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 18 2016 10:18:01 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"February, 23 2011 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Diane Patrick, First Lady of Massachusetts, helped us launch our landmark year","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":379,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":379,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:12:17 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/60th-Anniversary-4.jpg?w180-h180-x0-y5","author":"","title":"Community gathers for Big Sister's 60th Anniversary Launch","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Click on the player to watch Big Sister&#39;s CEO, Deborah Re, on WBZ TV&#39;s &quot;What&#39;s in our community&quot;.

In less than three weeks, more than 60 members of the Big Sister community purchased coats, hats, scarves, and gloves for 75 girls waiting for a Big Sister. This year, we reached out to the families on our wait list in an effort to support them during the holiday season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Chardonney.jpg\" /><br />\r\n<em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Chardanney, who is 13 years-old, lives in Roxbury,<br />\r\nand is waiting to be matched with a Big Sister, picked<br />\r\nup her new winter coat with her mother Clarissa</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a letter sent home to the families, we asked each girl to tell us what she enjoys most about winter, what she wishes for, and why she wants a Big Sister. Here&rsquo;s what a few of them had to say:<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Emely, age 10, lives in Mattapan with her mom, brother and sister.</strong><br />\r\n&ldquo;My favorite things about wintertime are that I can play in the snow, make snowmen and have HOT CHOCOLATE!

I want a Big Sister because I want someone to talk to and laugh with. I have only brothers and I&rsquo;m lonely.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe girls on the wait list weren&rsquo;t the only ones inspiring us though! As a Christmas gift to each other, a husband and wife provided coats, gloves, and scarves for 12 of the girls who live in Dorchester. A former Big Sister bought winter gear for two of the girls, even though she currently lives in Singapore! Many of our staff and Board members also purchased items for girls on the list.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe witnessed the holiday spirit bringing joy to the girls and their families on our wait list as each eagerly arrived at our office to pick up their items, and left with brightly wrapped packages and smiles on their faces. Thank you to those supporters who made this time of year a little warmer for all of them.

Big Sisters! On November 9, we celebrated our Big Sisters of the Year and Community Partner of the Year. These outstanding women have gone above and beyond in bringing our mission to life. The awards were presented by <strong>Tufts Health Plan</strong>, who believes in the healthy impact all of our Big Sisters are making on their Little Sisters and our community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Irene-Shui.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" />Irene Shui</strong><br />\r\nCommunity-Based Big Sister of the Year</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Irene, who lives in Jamaica Plain and is an epidemiologist for Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, has been matched with Little Sister Kiara for more than four years. In that time she&rsquo;s has helped the formerly shy Kiara, now 16, blossom into a more confident and outgoing young woman. Kiara lives with her mother and two brothers in the South End. Due to her eldest son&rsquo;s mental health and behavioral challenges, Kiara&rsquo;s mother feared that her daughter would get lost in the shuffle. Though Kiara&rsquo;s mother strives to set a positive example for her daughter, she felt a Big Sister would be able to expand Kiara&rsquo;s horizons in more ways. &ldquo;Irene takes the possibilities that I hold out to my daughter&mdash;that women can study hard, work hard, and play hard, travel, explore, and be independent, while still in loving relationships&mdash;and shows them to her as reality,&rdquo; said Kiara&rsquo;s mother. She describes the relationship between Irene and Kiara as &ldquo;positive, nurturing, and vital.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Irene does so much with her life: she&rsquo;s working, going to school, taking care of herself and her family, she travels, has fun, and has a life, but she always has time for me,&rdquo; said Kiara. Irene and Kiara enjoy activities ranging from the new and different to the everyday. They take advantage of community service opportunities together, love to watch movies and cook, and often just go for a walk and chat. &ldquo;We combine doing fun things with having serious conversations about our futures, school, jobs, relationships, and current events,&rdquo; said Irene. Through these interactions, Kiara credits her Big Sister with improving her social skills attitude toward learning &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been really shy, and I guess being around Irene so much has helped a lot,&rdquo; said Kiara. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s helped me improve my academic success too,&rdquo; added Kiara. &ldquo;I remember telling her at our first meeting that I loved to read and one of the first things she ever gave me was a book.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs to why she became a Big Sister, Irene said: &ldquo;So many strong female mentors have opened doors for me in my lifetime, so I&#39;ve always wanted to return the favor. I realized that some girls may not be lucky enough to have the opportunities I did while growing up and may lack access to strong women to be their mentors.&rdquo; According to Kiara&rsquo;s mother, Irene&rsquo;s simple, consistent presence in her daughter&rsquo;s life has been the key to opening up Kiara&rsquo;s world. She said: &ldquo;I have always pushed Kiara to achieve. I think Irene helps her to remember what all the hard work is for.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Jessica Roy</strong><br />\r\nCommunity-Based Big Sister of the Year</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Jessica, who lives in Natick and is a trader at The Baupost Group, has been matched with Little Sister Janelle for more than five years. Janelle lives with her parents and her twin brother in Boston&rsquo;s South End. Before she was matched with her Big Sister, Janelle felt insecure when kids at school teased her because of her weight. The teasing made it difficult for Janelle to concentrate on her schoolwork. Janelle&rsquo;s mother was pained to see her daughter&rsquo;s feelings hurt and upset that it was affecting her academic abilities. She felt that a caring adult outside the family who could broaden her daughter&rsquo;s horizons and spend time with her on a one-to-one basis would benefit Janelle<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNow at 13, Janelle has become an outgoing, self-assured young woman well-equipped to enter her teen years. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m seeing a new Janelle, and overall I like what I am seeing,&rdquo; said her mother. Janelle&rsquo;s friendship with Jessica has given her the confidence to make healthy decisions and do better in school. Janelle&rsquo;s mother reports that she is able to pick good friends and though she was once a struggling student, her grades now are mostly A&rsquo;s and B&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Jessica makes me feel seriously good,&rdquo; said Janelle. &ldquo;I was overweight and she helped me with healthier eating and exercise. The important thing about this was that I never felt criticized by her.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nJessica has witnessed the growth in her Little Sister&rsquo;s confidence as well. &ldquo;When we first met she was a little shy and I would have to ask her things a few times before she would answer, or she would hesitate to say something. Now we compete for air time!&rdquo; laughed Jessica. In addition to enjoying walks together, Jessica and Janelle love attending sporting events like Red Sox and Celtics games, and going to the movies. Jessica has also made a concerted effort to include Janelle in every stage of her life. When planning her wedding, Jessica asked her Little Sister for input. When Jessica recently had her first child, she continued to make time for Janelle. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t even take time off from me!&rdquo; exclaimed Janelle. Jessica has made it clear to her Little Sister that she will always be an important part of her life, even joking that they will one day be little old ladies together. &ldquo;I always know that Jessica thinks I&rsquo;m terrific,&rdquo; said Janelle. &ldquo;She supports me and helps me be a better me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Beth-Favaloro.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" />Beth Favaloro</strong><br />\r\nSchool-Based Big Sister of the Year</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Beth, who lives in Charlestown and is a managing director at Putnam Investments, has been matched with Little Sister Cindy for more than four years. Though Cindy, who is now in sixth grade, recently transitioned from the Josiah Quincy Elementary School in Chinatown to the Josiah Quincy Upper School, Beth continued to make Cindy a priority. &ldquo;It never crossed my mind not to come back each year,&rdquo; said Beth.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBeth has always been full of ideas, often creating lists with Cindy at the beginning of the year that include activities they would like to accomplish. These activities have ranged from takings pictures and making collages, to painting their nails, making bracelets, and playing games. &ldquo;I most enjoy when we talk about what&rsquo;s happening in our lives,&rdquo; said Cindy. Beth has consistently been open to the support of her Big Sister social worker and advocated for more Big and Little Sister matches at the school, notifying her social worker of girls who expressed an interest in the program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBeth has nurtured her Little Sister&rsquo;s confidence by being open and listening, which has allowed Cindy to shed her once intensely shy demeanor and become a gregarious young woman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been rewarding to see how outgoing Cindy has become over the years,&rdquo; said Beth. &ldquo;Now she always says hi to her teachers or friends and she has a story for me about who they are.&rdquo; When Cindy began insisting that Beth call her by her formal Chinese name, Chao, it was clear that the two had reached a turning point where Cindy was letting Beth into her personal life. &ldquo;I feel very special when I&rsquo;m with Beth,&rdquo; said Cindy. &ldquo;She is a caring person and she likes me for who I am.&rdquo; After two years of being matched with Beth, Cindy&rsquo;s teacher reported that Cindy had become more trusting of others, was better able to express herself, and seemed more confident. Beth&rsquo;s friendship has been woven into the fabric of Cindy&rsquo;s life at school. As Cindy put it, &ldquo;Awesome Big Sisters are hard to replace!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Liz-Micheels.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" />Liz Micheels</strong><br />\r\nGroup Mentoring Big Sister of the Year</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Big Sister&rsquo;s Group Mentoring program, TEAM (Team Enhanced Approach to Mentoring), runs throughout the academic year at middle schools in and around Boston. In this program, specifically designed to meet the developmental needs of adolescent girls, a group of Big Sisters engages in structured activities and discussions with a group of Little Sisters under the leadership of a Big Sister social worker or Master of Social Work level intern. While many TEAM Big Sisters may participate in the program for a couple of years, Liz has gone above and beyond in her commitment by volunteering as a TEAM Big Sister for seven years. She has participated in groups at the F.A. Day Middle school in Newtonville, the Andrew Peabody School in Cambridge, and most recently, the West End House Boys &amp; Girls Club in Allston.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLiz, who lives in Newton, has been a life-long volunteer, working with organizations that promote the healthy development of adolescents and women&rsquo;s reproductive health. When she heard about Big Sister, she knew it would be the perfect opportunity for her to follow her passion. Not only that, but as the mother of two grown boys, Liz said simply, &ldquo;I missed being with girls!&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLiz is dedicated to the work of Big Sister. She cares for the girls and strives to make them feel included in the group. She is attentive to the simple details like bringing a healthy snack for everyone and to the larger issues, such as sources of conflict among the girls. Even when girls question her authority and motives, Liz is able to understand this and accept that the girls may be challenging her for unspoken reasons. Most importantly, she never gives up on them. &ldquo;Even when the girls seem tough at first, I love the process of getting to know them, seeing how smart and caring they really are,&rdquo; said Liz. She remembers details about the girls&rsquo; lives, as well as her fellow Big Sisters, and makes a point to check in with each person. Liz consistently brings a positive attitude to the group that is contagious and genuine.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Jessica-Dugan.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin:10px\" />Jessica Dugan</strong><br />\r\nDirector of Community &amp; Business Partnerships, Boston Renaissance Charter School</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Community Partner of the Year<br />\r\nJessica has been the driving force behind Big Sister Association&rsquo;s partnership with the Boston Renaissance Charter School since 2004. In the past five years, we have served more than60 girls through our School-Based Mentoring program and 140 girls through our Group Mentoring programs at the school. &nbsp;Jessica has been a consistent, engaged site contact who believes strongly in our mission as an asset to the girls in her school. She has enthusiastically resolved challenges involving both space and scheduling to accommodate Big Sister&rsquo;s programs at the Renaissance. Through her leadership, our programs have become became an integrated component of the Renaissance&rsquo;s afterschool program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Big Sister&rsquo;s programs help the Renaissance School support the social and emotional development of our students. This is a core part of our mission as we work to eliminate barriers to our student&rsquo;s academic success,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;Girls gain skills in leadership, healthy decision-making, and social responsibility, with the added benefit of developing a relationship with a female mentor.&rdquo; Jessica advocated for the continuation of our partnership when the Renaissance made its transition from downtown Boston to Hyde Park this year. &ldquo;Because time is designated for this during the day, concerns are addressed appropriately and acknowledged as important rather than dismissed,&rdquo; said Jessica. &ldquo;When these needs have been acknowledged, the girls can then be more easily encouraged to move on and focus during core academic time.&rdquo; Due to Jessica&rsquo;s support, we will continue to partner with the school to provide Group Mentoring for the girls in the 2010-2011 academic year.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 18 2016 09:48:34 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"November, 19 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Big Sister Association and Tufts Health Plan honored four outstanding Big Sisters and one stellar Community Partner at Big in Boston","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":370,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":370,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:13:08 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Jessica-Dugan.jpg?w195-h195-x0-y1","author":"","title":"Meet our Big Sisters of the Year!","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Attention passengers: A girl&rsquo;s future is now approaching. &nbsp;This refrain rang out through the evening on Tuesday, November 9, at our annual<strong> Big in Boston</strong> celebration. Thanks to the more than 450 guests gathered at The Westin Copley Place Boston and Big in Boston&rsquo;s corporate sponsors, we raised more than $500,000 in support of Big Sister&rsquo;s mentoring programs for girls.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe night glittered with the sights and sounds of the T and the voices of those whose lives have been transformed by a Big Sister. &nbsp;Street musicians, images of trains racing by, and live announcements from <strong>Chief Paul MacMillan</strong> of the MBTA Transit Police evoked the daily ritual of many Bostonians. Guests dined in a ballroom where event guru <strong>Bryan Rafanelli</strong> made the familiar setting of a train station come alive, right down to the Charlie ticket napkin rings. &nbsp;Three ambitious Little Sisters, beaming at the Big Sisters by their side, opened the program by announcing what they plan to be when they are &ldquo;big&rdquo; in Boston: a physicist, an actress, and a vet. A man who truly is &ldquo;big&rdquo; in Boston then took the stage: <strong>Mayor Menino</strong>. &nbsp;The Mayor addressed the challenges facing girls today and lauded the Big Sisters and those who support us for being a key part of the solution.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs the evening progressed, guests heard from those who have been directly affected by our work. &nbsp;The first was <strong>Alyson Tayetto</strong>, a former Little Sister, who is now 22 years old and earning her Master&rsquo;s degree in psychology. She is the first in her family to attend and graduate from college. &nbsp;She spoke about the isolation she felt as a girl from Roxbury attending school in Lexington through the Metco program. Her school counselor recommended a Big Sister to help Alyson gain confidence and lessen the frustration and anger she felt at school. In 1998, Alyson was matched with Big Sister <strong>Susan Hook</strong>. &ldquo;My Big Sister simply let me be me. Instead of being passive and shy, I became confident. Instead of being angry and frustrated, I became happy,&rdquo; said Alyson. Among those listening to her speak was Susan Hook herself, who flew to Boston from Florida to support her former Little Sister!&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlyson&rsquo;s inspiring story was followed by <strong>Little Sister Janelle</strong> and her mother, Sharon, who shared a touching tribute to Janelle&rsquo;s <strong>Big Sister Jessica</strong>. Sharon spoke about raising her daughter in a neighborhood where she witnessed teenage girls getting pregnant and dropping out of school. Janelle was overweight and teased by other kids: &ldquo;I was worried that if Janelle didn&#39;t feel good about herself, she wasn&#39;t going to grow up making good decisions,&rdquo; said Sharon. &ldquo;I decided that a Big Sister could relate to Janelle on a level I just couldn&rsquo;t. Big Sister Association brought Jessica and my daughter together in a relationship that has been life-changing.&rdquo; In the five years since they were matched, Jessica has encouraged Janelle to lead a healthier, more active lifestyle. According to Janelle, Jessica never once criticized her. This non-judgmental support resulted in some serious changes for Janelle and a weight loss of 22 pounds. Sharon noted that she too became more active and started eating better as a result of her daughter&rsquo;s efforts.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe evening ended with the presentation of our <strong>B</strong>elieve<strong> I</strong>n <strong>G</strong>irls award. This year&rsquo;s recipient was <strong>At-Large City Councilor</strong>, <strong>Ayanna Pressley</strong>. Councilor Pressley was chosen in recognition of her civic leadership, advocacy on behalf of women and girls, support of mentoring, and the care and guidance she offers her own Little Sister of nearly one year, Arianna. &nbsp;She stressed: &ldquo;In order for girls to be it, they must first see it.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMany thanks are in order to those who made Big in Boston a success. We would like to thank Big in Boston co-chairs, <strong>Jerry Rossi</strong> of The<strong> TJX Companies</strong>,<strong> Inc</strong>. and <strong>Fredi Shonkoff</strong> of <strong>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts</strong>; to all of the evening&rsquo;s sponsors, particularly <strong>Holly McGrath</strong> &amp; <strong>David Bruce</strong>, and those featured on the right; the Big in Boston host committee; and our dedicated Board of Directors. We especially want to thank all those who attended and showed their support for Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls. It is through your generosity that we are able to transform our community by inspiring one girl at a time. We look forward to seeing you at next year&rsquo;s Big in Boston as we celebrate our 60th anniversary!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Big in Boston 2010 Host Committee</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\">Honorary Host Committee</h3>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">The Honorable Mayor Thomas M.

I heard fun things about having a Big Sister!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My Big Sister has helped me...</strong>learn to trust again, and has taught me that there are good people in the world.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Without my Big Sister I would not...</strong>have done some of the activities that we have done together. I probably wouldn&#39;t have been a flower girl in a wedding and I probably would not have done some of the silly things we like to do like wear fake moustaches.<br />\r\n<strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nOur favorite thing to do together has been...</strong>enjoying the party at Maryann&#39;s wedding where Tasia was a beautiful flower girl with some impressive dance skills. We felt lucky to share that special day together. We are also always down to go eat buffalo chicken somewhere!<br />\r\n<strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe are looking forward to...</strong>snow tubing this winter, trying snowboarding, and new activities and adventures together.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>I love being a Big Sister because...</strong>Tasia gives me perspective about what is important in life. She&#39;s shaped my weekends to be something to look forward to and made me try new things. It is awesome knowing that you are not only enriching your life, but someone else&#39;s too. We have a growing relationship and both put in the time and energy because we want to. That&#39;s a good feeling.<br />\r\nI love having a Big Sister because...I have someone to look forward to being silly with. I have a new family who shows me a lot of love. I feel like Maryann is a like a real big sister. I love that I can count on her and she never breaks a promise or commitment.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Since we&#39;ve been matched my Little Sister has really...</strong>become more confident in herself. Tasia is a strong girl who will fight for what&#39;s right for herself and for her family. She has become a great older sister herself, giving her little sister someone to lean on and learn from.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>It is important for girls today to have positive female mentors because...</strong>a lot of mainstream music, television, and movies are sending negative messages to girls about being someone they are not. A female mentor encourages you to be your best self, and be a leader, not a follower.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>My Big Sister is perfect for me because...</strong>we are a perfect match. I hit the Big Sister jackpot! Maryann understands me because she has had a similar life to mine and she is not scared to get silly with me.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Because of my Big Sister I will...</strong>pay it forward. I hope I can change a life like Maryann has done for me.

For others, she may be just another person in this world, but she&#39;s completely encouraged me to stay strong, even if that meant I had to crawl on my hands and knees to continue further in life. I wouldn&#39;t be the same person I am today, if I had not met her 8 years ago. I used to find it hard to make it through one whole day, and now I&#39;m stronger than ever.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis essay is supposed to be about my personal style, and my Big Sister has helped me build it over time. Personally, I feel that I&#39;m an outstanding person. I&#39;m classy, funky, sassy, unique, and stylish. The way I dress and pamper myself on the outside, shows exactly the way I feel on the inside. I love to express myself as a person, just to get me going. I love to feel that I have power over myself. What I like best about myself is how I change my style everyday. I love to express myself and explore many new things about myself. I like changing my style because it shows that as a person I have many talents, that I love to be outstanding, and that I have the potential along with great credentials. My Big Sisters has been important in building all these great things in me that have made me the strong, independent individual I am today.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFollowing a beauty and skincare session, Trinette, Jarelis, and Donna headed over to Newbury Street jewelry emporium, So Good, where Jarelis picked out $50 worth of accessories with the help of Trinette&rsquo;s style expertise. Trinette, who is also a volunteer in our Big for a Day program and a member of Big Sister&rsquo;s Alumnae Association, developed the contest as a way to give back to the program. &ldquo;I have been donating a portion of the proceeds from one of the lip glosses on Love Hue to Big Sister, but I really wanted to do something special for one of the girls they serve,&rdquo; said Faint. As for Jarelis, the most memorable part of the day was the goody bag of products Trinette used that she got to take home!</em></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 15 2016 10:08:54 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 08 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Little Sister Jarelis talks about how her Big Sister helps her define herself and her personal style","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":366,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":366,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:17:50 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Trinette-Jarelis.jpg?w246-h246-x18-y3","author":"","title":"Little Sister Jarelis wins personal style contest","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>The unseasonably hot and sunny weather on Saturday, September 25, brought new meaning to the term &ldquo;sweat equity&rdquo; for members of Team Big Sister, but that didn&rsquo;t keep them from giving it their all in the Rodman Ride for Kids.

Now, when I&#39;m bored, I just text my Big Sister. She always has something fun and interesting going on. I&#39;ve met cool people too, like Mayor Menino and Governor Patrick.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>I wanted a Big Sister because...</strong>I have two brothers, but I always wanted a sister to talk to and hang out with.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>My Big Sister has helped me...</strong>Even though she drives me crazy when she does it, I do at least think about eating vegetables now, or just eating healthier in general. My Big Sister makes me feel important. She always asks me what I think about an issue or something she&#39;s working on. My opinion matters to her. Sometimes I can be shy about sharing it, but she always asks. I&#39;m thinking about becoming a lawyer when I grow up, so my Big Sister asking me a lot of questions will help me to be a better lawyer. She always wants me to explain why I think or feel a certain way.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Without my Big Sister I would not...</strong>have as much fun. I love going to her apartment to hang out. We don&#39;t always have to go out to have a great time.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Our favorite thing to do together is...</strong>to go to the movies. Afterwards we get something to eat and talk about our favorite scenes. Sometimes my Big Sister gets mad because I figure out the movie ending early and ruin it for her.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>We are looking forward to...</strong>going bowling, maybe apple picking, and definitely planning and celebrating my sweet sixteen next February!<br />\r\n<strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\nI love being a Big Sister because...</strong>I am an only child, so it&#39;s been wonderful and new to have a Little Sister to hang out with, and occasionally lecture about school, her eating, boys, future goals etc. Did I say, occasionally lecture? I also love having Arianna in my life because she keeps me honest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I love having a Big Sister because...</strong>it&#39;s cool to have a grown up in my life who has gone through a lot of the same things that I have, but isn&#39;t so old that I can&#39;t relate to her or talk honestly.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Since we&#39;ve been matched my Little Sister has really...</strong>opened my eyes to the life challenges and mature decisions girls are faced with today. Listening to her inspires and informs everything that I do. She motivates me to do and be my best because I want to set the best example for her.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>It is important for girls today to have positive female mentors because...</strong>in order for girls to be it, they must first see it. Positive female mentors let them know what is possible.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>My Big Sister is perfect for me because...</strong>we have so much in common. Our names are almost identical. Our birthdays are two days apart, and we both love shoes--I love sneakers and she loves high heels. She loves cake and I love ice cream, so it works out.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Because of my Big Sister I will...</strong>achieve whatever I want in life, and have her support, advice, and occasional lecturing (about boys, my eating and texting) every step of the way. I know we&#39;ll always be in each other&#39;s lives.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 14 2016 15:21:27 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"September, 28 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":363,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":363,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:26:13 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Match of the Month: Big Sister Ayanna Pressley & Little Sister Arianna","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>At-Large Boston City Councilor, Ayanna Pressley, knows that youth mentoring is one of the most powerful catalysts we have for creating change among Boston&#39;s youth and families. While mentoring relationships that are professionally made and supported using research-based practices impact one child at a time, they create a ripple effect that is felt throughout the child&#39;s family, peer group, and community. As a Big Sister, the Councilor has experienced the positive effects of mentoring first-hand. &quot;Mentors provide the inspiration, drive, and support necessary to ensure our young people develop a roadmap for academic, professional, and life success,&quot; Pressley said. In order to provide this opportunity for more of Boston&#39;s youth, the Councilor recently launched Ayanna&#39;s BIG Challenge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/BIG-Challenge.gif\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><em>Robert Lewis, Jr., Vice President for Program at The Boston Foundation, and big Sister&#39;s CEO Deborah Re, kick-off Ayanna&#39;s BIG Challenge with the Councilor at Blackstone Square in the South End.&nbsp;</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ayanna&#39;s BIG Challenge is a year-long campaign that will recruit 50 women and men each month through Big Sister Association of Greater Boston and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay, which focuses on serving boys in our city. &nbsp;She officially kicked-off the campaign at Big Sister Association&#39;s &quot;Hunt for the Next Big Sister,&quot; held in partnership with Boston radio station, Hot 97, at Blackstone Square in the South End on September 11. &nbsp;Twenty-five women signed up to become Big Sisters that day, including two former Little Sisters! &nbsp;With more than 300 girls currently on our wait list to be matched with a Big Sister, Pressley has her work cut out for her. &nbsp;She will continue to promote her campaign at community gatherings and media appearances throughout the year. &quot;Mentoring is the most effective, most sustainable, most affordable way to make sure our young people get the childhood they deserve and the future they dream of,&quot; said Pressley.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPressley&#39;s historic win as the first woman of color to be elected to the Boston City Council positions her not only as an ideal spokeswoman for recruiting more mentors, but also as a role model to girls throughout our City. &quot;Growing up, I didn&#39;t have access to programs like Big Sister Association. There weren&#39;t many gender-specific opportunities for me, and so outside of my mother, I really didn&#39;t have adult mentors. As I became more interested in public service, I looked up to Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. She was a black woman, outspoken and eloquent, fiery and passionate who spoke about the issues I was just starting to realize I wanted to work on,&quot; said Pressley of her own path. She hopes that her current position will break down more barriers for the next generation. &quot;Gender is not an obstacle to any opportunity. The critical part is that every girl needs to know that, believe that, and make the choices necessary to make the most of that opportunity.&quot; &nbsp;With the help of Councilor Pressley&#39;s campaign, more girls will have the care, support, and attention of Big Sisters who play a critical role in letting them know they matter.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>So, are you up for the Challenge?

Unemployment was already hovering around 9 percent for Massachusetts residents, and predictions were made that nationally only about one-quarter of teens seeking summer jobs would actually get them.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFour young women, supported by the Boston Youth Fund, worked at Big Sister Association of Greater Boston during July and August. Each of them told us that had it not been for this job opportunity they most likely would have been sitting at home, watching TV, playing on the computer or just hanging out.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHowever, their experience was more than just a chance to get out of the house, earn some money and stay on the path to success. These four young women, working in an environment whose mission is dedicated to supporting the healthy development of women and girls, got a taste of the respect, responsibility and confidence that comes with a job well done.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIf we are to build a better Boston it is clear that we must work together in support of the healthy development of our youth. We have the power to keep them safe, build their confidence, and even change the trajectory of their lives. As a business community, we have so much to offer them, and sometimes the best offer we can make is simply a job.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Deborah Re</strong><br />\r\n<em>Chief executive officer,<br />\r\nBig Sister Association of Greater Boston</em></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 14 2016 15:17:07 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"September, 13 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Read about the importance of summer jobs programs, like the Boston Youth Fund, in our letter to the editor featured in this week's Boston Business Journal","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":362,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":362,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:27:25 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Putting teens to work","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<h3>Each month we introduce you to one of our Big and Little Sister matches and give you a glimpse into the special bond they share.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Big Sister Maurie Lewis &amp; Little Sister Sarina</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Maurie lives in Newton and Sarina, 10, lives in Hyde Park.

Once again this year, we witnessed random acts of goodwill from ticket buyers, including a purchase from an anonymous woman who asks only that her ticket be put in the name of someone who really needs it. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAt Friday&rsquo;s drawing,<strong> Big Sister Zoe </strong>and <strong>Little Sister Empress</strong> were joined by <strong>Big Sisters Judy Dombrowski </strong>and <strong>Evelyn Robertson</strong>, and their <strong>Little Sisters Ashlyn</strong>, 16, of Jamaica Plain, and <strong>Idalis</strong>, 12, of Dorchester. &nbsp;Each match shared with the crowd what makes their friendship so special. &nbsp;They also got to pick the winning tickets for our fantastic runner-up prizes.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nCongratulations to all of this year&rsquo;s winners:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Additional Prizes</strong><br />\r\nRed Sox tickets<strong>--Matt Hudson, #1603</strong><br />\r\nLegal Sea Foods clambake<strong>--Arlene Taylor, #22</strong><br />\r\nSunset dinner cruise<strong>--Cecil Gilbert, #911&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Online Mini Raffle&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nPriceless Hank Aaron autographed baseball<strong>--Roberta Hurtig</strong><br />\r\n$50 Oleana gift card<strong>--Margaret Nelson</strong><br />\r\n$50 Starbucks gift card<strong>--Jeff Donnelly</strong><br />\r\n$50 Amazon.com gift card<strong>--Thomas Beaudoin</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBig thanks to our raffle partner, <a href=\"http://www.herbchambersbmwofboston.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Herb Chambers BMW of Boston</strong></a>, and to our site partners who allowed us to sell tickets on their properties: &nbsp;<a href=\"http://larzanderson.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Larz Anderson Auto Museum</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://www.equityoffice.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Equity Office Properties</strong></a>, <a href=\"http://www.verizon.com/home/verizonglobalhome/ghp_landing.aspx\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Verizon</strong></a>, <strong><a href=\"http://www.cbre.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CB Richard Ellis</a></strong>, and <a href=\"http://www.faneuilhallmarketplace.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Faneuil Hall Marketplace</strong></a>.

/>\r\nI APPLAUD Kevin Cullen for calling attention to the ripple effect caused by violence in our city (<a href=\"http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/08/held_captive_by_violence/\" target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;Held captive by violence,&rsquo;&rsquo;</a> Metro, June 8). In the face of the horrific acts of violence, it is easy to overlook the issues associated with it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhat are the implications for the children who aren&rsquo;t victims of this violence? Girls waiting for a Big Sister frequently say they just want someone who will take them out of the house.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPeople have said Jaewon Martin, the boy who was shot on the basketball court at the Bromley-Heath development, was in the wrong place at the wrong time. He wasn&rsquo;t in the wrong place. He was exactly where a 14-year-old boy should be &mdash; outside, being active.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBut with this increasing violence comes increasing fear, as with the mother on Creston Street who was &ldquo;in for the night&rsquo;&rsquo; at 2 p.m.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThere is no simple solution to ending the violence, but there is a long-term option for diminishing its effect on the community: become a mentor. As mentors, we can give children a chance to be free of the fear, isolation, and captivity. Reserve the prison sentence for those who perpetrate the violence, not those simply trying to live through it.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nDeborah Re<br />\r\nChief executive<br />\r\nBig Sister Association of Greater Boston<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&copy; Copyright 2010 Globe Newspaper</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 14 2016 13:43:54 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"June, 16 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Read our Boston Globe Letter to the Editor addressing the need for mentors to counteract the impact of violence in our community","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"Boston Globe","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":356,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/08/held_captive_by_violence/","download":"","contentId":356,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:28:27 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Kids Living in Fear Need Mentors","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<h3>Each month we introduce you to one of our Big and Little Sister matches and give you a glimpse into the special bond they share.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Big Sister Lindsay Gosselin &amp; Little Sister Makayla</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Lindsay lives in South Boston. &nbsp;Makayla, age 11, lives in Dorchester.

Now in its eleventh year, this was the most successful dinner to date, thanks to our generous sponsors and guests. Owner and renowned chef, <strong>Michael Schlow</strong>, hosted the dinner which featured dishes from six of Boston&rsquo;s gastronomic gurus.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Seth Raynor</strong>, of <strong>The Pearl </strong>restaurant on Nantucket, started off the meal with a poached shrimp ceviche served with a green chili and pickled fruit sauce. <strong>Stella&rsquo;s Evan Deluty</strong> followed with an impressive dish of seared scallops with butter potatoes and truffle vinaigrette. <strong>Ting Yen </strong>of <strong>Oishii</strong> kept with the sumptuous seafood theme by serving black cod and sweet miso sauce. <strong>Tony Maws</strong> of <strong>Craigie</strong> <strong>on Main </strong>mixed it up with delicious farro pasta and mini lamb meatballs, while <strong>Via Matta&rsquo;s Mike Pagliarini </strong>rounded out the main courses with a tender slow roasted rib eye (donated by <strong>Savenor&rsquo;s</strong>) accompanied by spring vegetables. For dessert, <strong>Radius&rsquo; </strong>own <strong>Matthew Audette</strong> pulled out all the stops with a decadent chocolate chibouste complemented by fudge ice cream and a spicy cherry sauce.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn between courses, <strong>emcee Lisa Hughes of WBZ-TV </strong>kept guests engaged and shared a very special letter written by Lucy Benitez, mother of <strong>Little Sister Chauntae</strong>. Thanks to the generosity of last year&rsquo;s Celebrity Chef Dinner guests, 14 year-old Chauntae of Roxbury was able to come off our waiting list and was matched with <strong>Big Sister Amy Malone</strong>. The relationship has been nothing less than life-changing. In her letter, Lucy shared that two years ago Chauntae experienced a traumatic episode that plunged her into a deep depression. After months of unsuccessful visits to therapists and doctors, Lucy called Big Sister Association. When Chauntae was matched with Big Sister Amy in October 2009, she knew she had finally found someone she could open up to and trust, who listened with an open heart and mind. By Thanksgiving, Lucy felt like she was getting her daughter back. Following Lisa&rsquo;s reading of the letter, Chauntae, who attended the dinner with her Big Sister, got up and thanked everyone who contributed to taking her off the waiting list and giving back her smile.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe evening concluded with the opportunity for guests to take more girls like Chauntae off our wait list of 300 girls. Adding to the excitement, Michael Schlow graciously offered two packages to those who bid $10,000 to take 10 girls off the waiting list. The first package featured a golf outing and dinner with Schlow and Evan Deluty, and the second included a season pass to Radius&rsquo; cooking classes paired with the chance to be sous chef for the day. Thanks to the generosity of those who gave during this segment, 79 girls can now be matched with a Big Sister.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe are most grateful to Michael Schlow and his fellow chefs for creating a memorable evening. Special thanks are in order for our <strong>event co-chairs, Max Bardeen </strong>and <strong>Sharon McNally</strong>, who worked tirelessly to make the event the success that it was. And we would also like to extend a big thank you to our sponsors: Executive Chef Sponsor:<strong> The Connors Family</strong>; Chef de Cuisine Sponsor: <strong>Normandy Real Estate Partners</strong>; Sous Chef Sponsors: <strong>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts</strong>, <strong>Partners HealthCare</strong>, <strong>Suffolk Construction&rsquo;s Red &amp; Blue Foundation</strong>, and<strong> UBS Financial Services, Inc</strong>.; and Chef de Partie Sponsor, <strong>Natixis Global Associates</strong>. Finally, we wish to thank everyone who helped us put caring and supportive mentors in the lives of more of Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe look forward to sharing delightful dishes and inspiring stories again with you at next year&rsquo;s Celebrity Chef Dinner!</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef1.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef2.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef3.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef4.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef5.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef6.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef7.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef8.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef9.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef10.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef11.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef12.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef13.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef14.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef15.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef16.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef17.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef18.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef19.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef20.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef21.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef22.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef23.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef24.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef25.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef26.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef27.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef28.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef29.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef30.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef31.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef32.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef33.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef34.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef35.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef36.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef37.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef38.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef39.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef40.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef41.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef42.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef43.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef44.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef45.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef46.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/4-10-Celebrity-Chef47.jpg\"}]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April,

Big Sister has always known the important role that gender plays in mentoring, and now we have the research to prove it. More than 50 practitioners and funders gathered at <strong>Bank of New York Mellon</strong> on Friday, March 26, to hear nationally known researchers, <strong>Dr. Jean Rhodes</strong> of UMASS Boston&rsquo;s Donahue Institute, and <strong>Dr. Ren&eacute;e Spencer</strong> of Boston University&#39;s School of Social Work, share the findings of their respective studies on the role of gender in mentoring. &nbsp; The event, <strong>Getting Results: &nbsp;Why Gender Matters in Mentoring</strong>, was hosted by Bank of New York Mellon and Big Sister Association of Greater Boston in partnership with The Girls&#39; Coalition of Greater Boston.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFormer Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Health, <strong>Dr. Deborah Prothrow-Stith</strong>, moderated and spoke eloquently about her own experience in a gender-specific setting, as a student at Spelman College. She reminded the audience that when a woman or girl is allowed a gender-specific environment, it lets her focus on her own strengths and weaknesses, and creates space to better herself for herself. &nbsp;She gave the example that at Spelman, if she didn&rsquo;t win an academic prize, a Black woman still did; and that was her impetus to improve her own skills. &nbsp;This remained an important theme throughout the morning, as the research revealed numerous examples of Big Sisters inspiring their Little Sisters to develop and enhance skills in the context of a supportive relationship.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe researchers made it clear that relationships among girls, and women, drive developmental outcomes. &nbsp;They spoke to this in a variety of ways, including their personal mentor-mentee relationship in the field of mentoring research. &nbsp;Rhodes and Spencer also addressed this topic in their responses to a range of questions from the attendees: What was the appropriate target population for youth mentoring? &nbsp;What kind of impact do race and culture have? How can this be applied to the efficacy of group mentoring programs?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nCentral to the event&rsquo;s objective was the focus on the ways in which mentor influence is unique to girls. &nbsp;Dr. Spencer&rsquo;s study presented qualitative research on the impact of the mentoring relationship between girls and women. &nbsp;She emphasized that positive outcomes in these relationships are derived from engaged, authentic emotional support and companionship, and that new skills and confidence are built through collaboration. &nbsp;Spencer illustrated her findings with an anecdote about a Big and Little Sister who practiced singing into their hairbrushes together to ease the Little Sister&rsquo;s nerves and increase her confidence around auditioning for school musicals.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nDr. Rhodes&rsquo; study focused on quantitative research that showed: &ldquo;clear differences between girls and boys with respect to what they bring to the mentoring relationship, what they get out of the mentoring relationship, how long the matches last, and their level of satisfaction with their mentors over time. Given the results of these analyses, we can only confirm the importance of continuing to offer mentoring programs that take these differences into account and that build on the inherent variations between female and male youth.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her findings were what we often see in our Little Sisters: &nbsp;improvements in relationships with parents and teachers, attitude toward school, school behavior, grades, and self-worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><a href=\"/about-us/impact\">Click here</a> for more on how girls and boys experience mentoring relationships differently and how these differences matter when it comes to improving outcomes.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Gender-Matters1.jpg\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Board members Sharon McNally, of the Connors<br />\r\nFamily Office, and Lisa Scannell, with Mass<br />\r\nMentoring&#39;s David Shapiro</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Gender-Matters2.jpg\" /></strong><br />\r\n<em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Deborah Prothrow-Stith shares her<br />\r\nexperience with the positive impact of a<br />\r\ngender-specific environment</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Gender-Matters3.jpg\" /></strong><br />\r\n<em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Jean Rhodes and Ren&eacute;e Spencer discuss their<br />\r\nrespective studies on the role of gender<br />\r\nin mentoring</span></em></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 14 2016 10:40:11 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"April, 02 2010 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Jean Rhodes, Renée Spencer, and Deborah Prothrow-Stith talk gender and mentoring at BNY Mellon-sponsored event","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":349,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":349,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:29:31 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Gender-Matters1.jpg?w198-h198-x27-y2","author":"","title":"New Research: Why Gender Matters","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<h3>Each month we introduce you to one of our Big and Little Sister matches and give you a glimpse into the special bond they share.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Big Sister Amanda Martinez &amp; Little Sister Mickaella</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>Amanda lives in Quincy and is also a member of Big Sister&#39;s Diversity Council, whose members recruit women of color from their personal and professional networks to become Big Sisters. &nbsp;The Council also fosters partnerships with neighborhood organizations that work with communities of color. &nbsp;Mickaella, age 12, lives in Cambridge.

The reality is that 45% of the teen births in Massachusetts in 2007 were among the white, non-Hispanic population, making it the highest of any ethnicity in the state (according to data provided by the Mass Alliance on Teen Pregnancy).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHowever, one thing was clear: &nbsp;there was no pact; there was simply a group of girls who could have benefitted from the care and support of someone who could show them more options than teen motherhood. &nbsp;In the panel discussion afterward we learned that there is in fact a mentoring program now in place for girls in Gloucester (which is outside of Big Sister&rsquo;s service area). &nbsp;But teen pregnancy and a mentor&rsquo;s role in preventing it are not new. The fact is, teen pregnancy is on the rise in Massachusetts and across the nation, and has become almost in vogue again in regard to the attention it is receiving (MTV&rsquo;s 16 and Pregnant and Teen Mom, anyone?) &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a topic we often discuss at Big Sister and one on which our social workers often counsel our volunteers (&ldquo;My Little Sister is telling me her friends are all starting to have sex, how do I respond?&rdquo;).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe want to encourage you to see this film, to bring your Little Sister or another teen girl you care about.

Each woman has gone above and beyond in her commitment to girls and mentoring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Community-Based Mentoring Big Sisters of the Year</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Joy-Falk.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Joy Falk</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Joy, who lives in Brighton and works at the Harvard School of Public Health, has been matched with her Little Sister Roseanne, 15, of Allston, since October 2005. Roseanne says she likes her Big Sister because &ldquo;She&rsquo;s smart, funny, easy to get along with, and always has good ideas for what to do&hellip;not to mention she understands that there is no such thing as too much frosting.&rdquo; Joy and Roseanne often attend Big Sister-sponsored activities and are known for the unique costumes they create every year for the Big and Little Sister Halloween party. Most recently they dressed up as &ldquo;self-rescuing&rdquo; princesses. The costume serves as a testament to the confidence Joy has instilled in her Little Sister; confidence derived from the trusting relationship Joy formed with Roseanne. When asked what kinds of new experiences Joy has encouraged her Little Sister to try, Roseanne responded simply, &ldquo;Where do I start?&rdquo; Roseanne&rsquo;s mother says that since being matched with Joy, her daughter has become more confident, more willing to try new activities, and more committed to those activities. Their match is supported by Big Sister social worker Jessica Mendenhall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Susan-M.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Susan Magosci</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Susan, who lives in Milton and works at the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Commission, has been matched with her Little Sister Tiarra, 16, of Stoughton, since October 2002. Susan has not only given Tiarra crucial one-on-one attention, she also engaged her in many activities that Tiarra&rsquo;s mother is unable to. Susan&rsquo;s consistent presence in her Little Sister&rsquo;s life has resulted in several positive outcomes for Tiarra. &ldquo;Since Tiarra has been matched with Susan, her self-esteem has improved, her academic abilities have improved and she has a better understanding about life and people,&rdquo; says Tiarra&rsquo;s mother. She adds that Susan&rsquo;s involvement has not only benefited Tiarra, but also her entire family by giving Tiarra another adult she can turn to for support. Their match is supported by Big Sister social worker Emily Goldstein.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Shannon-R.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Shannon Robinson</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Shannon, who lives in Dorchester and works at Hemenway &amp; Barnes, has been matched with her Little Sister Miranda, 14, of Mattapan, since November 2002. Shannon helps Miranda navigate adolescence by creating an open and honest relationship with her. Miranda often confides in her Big Sister and turns to her for advice. Miranda respects Shannon for the way she supports her in making positive, healthy decisions, but does not make them for her. &ldquo;Shannon has helped me by letting me know my rights and showing me right from wrong,&rdquo; says Miranda. Miranda&rsquo;s grandmother, who is raising her, adds, &ldquo;I have seen Miranda grow up to be a fine teenager with the help of Shannon.&rdquo; Shannon is also a member of Big Sister&rsquo;s Diversity Council, which aims to recruit more women of color to volunteer as Big Sisters. Their match is supported by Big Sister social worker Jessica Mendenhall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>School-Based Mentoring Big Sisters of the Year</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Kathleen-H.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Kathleen Hewitt</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Kathleen, who lives in Scituate, was matched with Kari, 11, at the Parker Elementary School in Quincy in April 2007. When Kari made the transition to Quincy&rsquo;s Atlantic Middle School this year, she and Kathleen continued to meet weekly during Kari&rsquo;s lunch time. While the two enjoy being silly and playing games when they get together (Kathleen has yet to beat Kari at cards!), they also take time to work on building Kari&rsquo;s assertiveness. Though Kari was once very shy, she is now able to approach her peers with confidence on the playground. She and Kathleen even got up on stage and sang during lunch! Kari says the best part about having Kathleen as a Big Sister is that &ldquo;She always listens to me when I have problems and makes me laugh a lot.&rdquo; For Kathleen, the best part about being Kari&rsquo;s Big Sister is &ldquo;seeing Kari&rsquo;s face light up when I come through the door every week.&rdquo; Their match is supported by Big Sister social worker Meaghan Quinlan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Kelly-M.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Kelly Morgan</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly, who lives in Boston and works at Seaward Management, was matched with Joyce, 12, at the Josiah Quincy Elementary School in March 2006. Joyce is now in seventh grade at the Josiah Quincy Upper School and continues to meet with Kelly weekly. &ldquo;I love seeing Joyce evolve and grow up. &nbsp;Life is tough and growing up is not easy. &nbsp;I hope that I help Joyce with this process by accepting her no matter what and always being there for her,&rdquo; says Kelly. Kelly&rsquo;s consistent presence in her Little Sister&rsquo;s life has created a strong sense of trust in Joyce and helped to nurture Joyce&rsquo;s strengths. &ldquo;Kelly always comes up with activities to support Joyce&rsquo;s needs, from more structured projects at the beginning, to more conversation-based interactions now that they have built a comfortable friendship,&rdquo; says Ashley Jackson, the Big Sister social worker who supports the match and nominated Kelly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Group Mentoring Big Sister of the Year</h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Rose-S.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Rose Seyfried</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Rose, a student at Berklee College of Music, (pictured at the far left with her fellow Big Sisters) is currently in her second year as a Group Mentoring Big Sister. In 2008, Rose volunteered in the group held at the Central Middle School in Quincy. This year, Rose is a Big Sister at the Renaissance Charter School in Boston. Rose is deeply committed to her groups and even arranged to travel to Quincy with the group leader because she did not have transportation of her own. She builds strong relationships with the girls she mentors and her fellow Big Sisters. &ldquo;When I was 13 I didn&rsquo;t have someone in this kind of role,&rdquo; says Rose. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an amazing experience to be that person for a girl now.&rdquo; She adds that she likes Group Mentoring because &ldquo;the girls in the group get a cross-section of women to learn from. All the Big Sisters have something unique to offer.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Community Partner of the Year</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Linda-C.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Linda Clarke, Vice Principal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>William Blackstone Elementary School, South End, Boston<br />\r\nLinda has supported and fostered the growth of Big Sister&rsquo;s School-Based Mentoring program at the Blackstone since 2002. She serves as a liaison between the school and our social workers who make and support the Big and Little Sister matches. Her support allowed us to serve 43 girls at the Blackstone during the 2008-2009 school year. Linda also serves as a resource to the Big and Little Sisters who meet at her school. She considers the Big Sister program to be an important part of the student support services available at the Blackstone, and takes time to refer girls to the program in addition to her other responsibilities as vice principal. Additionally, Linda secured a designated classroom space for Big and Little Sisters to meet in during their weekly visits, which allows for quality one-on-one time together.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 14 2016 09:19:39 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"November, 20 2009 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Meet seven remarkable women whom we honored this year at Big in Boston","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":341,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":341,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:31:05 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Kathleen-H.jpg","author":"","title":"Big Sisters and Community Partner of the Year Honored","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>November 12 was a very BIG night, full of little moments that reminded us all why inspiring a girl has the power to transform our community. &nbsp;Despite a year of economic uncertainty, the Big Sister supporters, including co-chairs<strong> Jack Connors, Jr.</strong> and<strong> Melissa M. MacDonnell</strong>, gathered at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum for the biggest Big in Boston yet.<strong> The event raised more than $600,000 to benefit our mentoring programs for girls.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt was clear to more than 400 guests in the room that despite exceeding our fundraising goal for this event, there is still much work to be done. There are more than 300 girls currently waiting to be matched with a Big Sister. Every year there are hundreds of Big and Little Sister matches that need to be made and supported in addition to hundreds of women who need to receive the training necessary for a successful mentoring relationship.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEvery aspect of our work was celebrated at Big in Boston. In a special pre-event ceremony, we recognized seven outstanding women for their commitment to the girls we serve: Big Sisters of the Year<strong>, Joy Falk; Kathleen Hewitt; Susan Magocsi; Kelly Morgan; Shannon Robinson; and Community Partner of the Year, Linda Clarke, Assistant Principal at the William Blackstone Elementary School in Boston&rsquo;s South End.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nDuring the main event, guests were treated to an array of voices representing the power of mentoring. The program opened with a video featuring the wishes and hopes of girls waiting for a Big Sister, as well as prominent Bostonians&mdash;such as<strong> Liz Walker</strong>, <strong>Paul Guzzi</strong>, and <strong>Lydia Shire</strong>&mdash;reading letters written by current Little Sisters. <strong>Former Little Sister Colleen White </strong>then took the stage, telling her story of growing up in South Boston: &ldquo;Things at home were almost always chaotic...it never felt like a real family because I was always on my own,&rdquo; Colleen said. &ldquo;For all the good things in my neighborhood, there was a lot of negative too. I saw drug and alcohol abuse and constant fights, no matter where I went. It seemed like it would be really easy to slip into that world.&rdquo; When she first met her Big Sister, <strong>Kristen Herlihy</strong>, at age 11 Colleen was wary of this woman whom she described as &ldquo;definitely not from Southie.&rdquo; But in time, Kristen became Colleen&rsquo;s rock. For the next nine years, Kristen was Colleen&rsquo;s best friend, confidant, and biggest supporter; and she continues to fill that role to this day. Now that Colleen is 20 years old and a proud member of the United States Army National Guard, she is in the process of becoming a Big Sister herself.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe evening continued with a delicious sit-down dinner and live music by <strong>17 year old jazz sensation, Grace Kelly.</strong> Grace is already in her second year at Berklee College of Music, has recorded five CDs, and has performed around the world with some of the top performers in jazz. In between songs, Grace gave a special message of hope and determination to the Little Sisters gathered in the room. As a shining example of where you can go when someone like a mentor believes in you&mdash;and allows you to believe in yourself&mdash;Grace advised them to follow their own dreams, no matter what those dreams may be.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFinally, we honored the <strong>Women&rsquo;s Network of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce</strong> with the first-ever <strong>Believe in Girls Award</strong>. In 2007, the Women&rsquo;s Network chose to partner with Big Sister Association. The partnership has allowed us to expand our community, recruit volunteers, gain visibility, and engage new board members. <strong>Katy O&rsquo;Neil, the Chamber&rsquo;s Executive Vice President of Member Services</strong>, accepted the award from Little Sister Alina and her Big Sister Kirsten Doyle. Kirsten became a Big Sister after hearing about us at a Women&rsquo;s Network Breakfast in 2008. On October 30, Kirsten celebrated her one year anniversary with her Little Sister.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe would like to extend a big thank you to our presenting sponsor, <strong>Liberty Mutual</strong>, as well as our Leader Sponsor, <strong>Holly McGrath </strong>and <strong>David Bruce</strong>. We would also like to acknowledge crucial support from our <a href=\"#Big in Boston\"><strong>Champion, Connector, Organizer, and Activist sponsors</strong></a>. Of course we could not have hosted such a successful event without the commitment of our co-chairs Jack Connors, Jr. and Melissa M.

She has a great amount of natural ability and the ability to adapt that is the hallmark of a first-class jazz musician.&rdquo; -Wynton Marsalis</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nShe&rsquo;s recorded more albums than Miley Cyrus. She plays more instruments than Taylor Swift. She&rsquo;s performed with more legends in her musical genre than Britney Spears, but she won&rsquo;t be starring in the next Disney movie, appearing on lunch boxes, or lending her name to the latest department store clothing line. She&rsquo;s Grace Kelly, and she is amazing.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOn November 12, Grace, the Brookline-based jazz sensation, will be performing at Big Sister Association&rsquo;s signature event, Big in Boston, held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum. Not only will she fill the room with musical talent well beyond her years, she will also represent what is at the core of Big Sister&rsquo;s mission: when someone is there to believe in you and support you, there is no limit to what you can do, become, or achieve.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nGrace first picked up a saxophone at the age of 10, and hasn&rsquo;t put it down since. She became the youngest student ever to complete the four-year Jazz Studies Certificate Program at New England Conservatory Prep School. At age 15, Grace was offered a full scholarship to attend Berklee College of Music. She finished her high school requirements and entered Berklee College at age sixteen. She is currently in her sophomore year.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSays Grace of the musical mentors that have helped her on a path to success: <em>I have been very lucky throughout my career in music to have many wonderful mentors. Jazz greats such as Lee Konitz, Frank Morgan, Phil Woods and Wynton Marsalis have taken me under their wing and had me perform with them. However, when I first started in music there was one person in particular who was a significant mentor to me. My elementary music teacher Ken Berman was the first one to discover my talent and help nurture it. When I was in kindergarten he heard me sing and immediately recognized it as real talent. Ken is also a great jazz pianist and wonderful musician. He was the one who stayed after school to work on songs with me, encouraged me to do my first solo performance at school, and later emboldened me to record my first CD at age 12. We all know it&rsquo;s important to have support from your family and friends, and that of course means a lot, but to have a professional musician who mentors you is irreplaceable. Mr. Berman challenged me, supported me, and believed in me so much. He watched me grow musically and was there throughout the years to help me out. He helped me find my passion and for that I will be forever thankful.</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNow just seventeen, Grace has already recorded and performed with many notable musicians including Dave Brubeck, Hank Jones, Wynton Marsalis, Harry Connick, Jr., Lee Konitz, Phil Woods, Kenny Barron, Piano Jazz with Marian McPartland, Dianne Reeves, James Cotton, and the Boston Pops, among others. She has recorded five CDs and performed around the world.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhat makes her a great role model for the girls we serve&mdash;and girls everywhere&mdash;who want to have a career in music is that she has not had a meteoric rise to fame, though she could have gone that route. Today&rsquo;s girls are inundated with images of instant fame: the tween set who become their own brand before they&rsquo;re even old enough to drive, the American Idol hopefuls who need only endure Simon Cowell&rsquo;s grueling remarks to make it into the national spotlight. Instead, she is taking her time to arrive at the stardom for which she is destined. While Grace&rsquo;s reputation as an extraordinary musician is growing, she continues to study her craft and to explore new areas of music. Not only is she an accomplished saxophonist, she is also a singer, songwriter, composer, and arranger. She plays the alto saxophone, soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, piano, clarinet, flute, drums, and bass. In addition to jazz, she embraces blues, funk, rock and contemporary styles. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe look forward to not only hearing Grace&rsquo;s inspiring music on November, 12, but also her thoughts on the power of mentoring in helping girls follow their dreams.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 13 2016 10:38:07 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 05 2009 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"The 17 year old jazz sensation is an inspiration to girls","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":338,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":338,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 04 2016 08:11:13 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Grace-Kelly.jpg?w180-h180-x0-y1","author":"","title":"Grace Kelly to perform at Big in Boston!","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>There was no stopping Team Big Sister at this year&rsquo;s Rodman Ride for Kids!

Riders and friends joined us for several events in support of Team Big Sister leading up to the big day: a kick-off party, a fundraising social for young professionals, team spinning classes, and boot camp.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOn Ride day, participants cycled a scenic route around southeastern Massachusetts and ended with a celebratory barbeque at the finish line. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m fortunate to have the experience of not only raising crucial funds for Big Sister as a rider, but also seeing the benefits of those funds through the amazing friendship I share with my Little Sister Toni,&rdquo; said <strong>Laura Toni Holsinger, who in addition to being a Team Big Sister rider and Big Sister to 13 year old Little Sister Toni, is also a staff member. </strong>&ldquo;There are so many girls in Boston that could benefit from the care and attention of a Big Sister, and I&rsquo;m proud to have ridden 25 miles in support of that!&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe would like to thank Team Big Sister sponsors, <strong>Shawmut Design &amp; Construction</strong> and <strong>Gerry McCarthy of Mortgage Masters, Inc.</strong> We also want to thank our fantastic team captains, <strong>Andie Morales </strong>and <strong>Lisa Scannell</strong>, in addition to all those who rode, raised money, and the generous folks who donated to them. We&rsquo;re already tuning our bikes up for next year&rsquo;s Ride and hope that you will join us!</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride1.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride2.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride3.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride4.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride5.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride6.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride7.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride8.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride9.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride10.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride11.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride12.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride13.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride14.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride15.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride16.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride17.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride18.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride19.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride20.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride21.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride22.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride23.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride24.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride25.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride26.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride27.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride28.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride29.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride30.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride31.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride32.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride33.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride34.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride35.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride36.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride37.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride38.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride39.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride40.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride41.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride42.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride43.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride44.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride45.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride46.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride47.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride48.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride49.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride50.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride51.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride52.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/09-Rodman-Ride53.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url

A great mix of guests, paired with a beachy, urban vibe, the event was the perfect way to kick off the summer and garner support for Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls. <strong>Legal Sea Foods</strong> provided a spread of Asian, ocean, and even Fenway (think hot dogs and chips) inspired food, while <strong>Sam Adams </strong>and <strong>Barefoot Wine &amp; Bubbly </strong>kept the party festive with summery libations. <strong>Smartwater</strong> was on hand too, keeping guests hydrated as they danced the night away to a sizzling soundtrack spun by<strong> Rebel the Ambassador</strong>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSeveral lucky bidders took home more than just memories of a great evening.

The first was <strong>Stephanie Lee</strong>, regional director of public affairs for Verizon, who announced to the Board that the Verizon Foundation had just granted Big Sister $15,000 to support a new cyber-safety initiative. &ldquo;The Verizon Foundation is pleased to partner with Big Sister Association to help girls safely use technology that is so much a part of our lives,&rdquo; said Lee. &ldquo;We commend Big Sister&rsquo;s efforts to empower girls to reach their fullest potential.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFollowing that announcement, <strong>Paul Grogan, President and CEO of The Boston Foundation</strong>, which awarded Big Sister $100,000 in December, spoke about the important role mentoring plays in the overall health of our city. &ldquo;We need to invest in the organizations that are doing the best work and having the most impact so that our city can continue to grow and move forward,&rdquo; said Grogan. He cited the fact that children with mentors do better in school and may be less likely to drop out if there is a caring adult supporting them and giving them the attention they need. He also shared some intriguing data about the relationship between level of education and quality of life to illustrate why children need to stay in school.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAt the meeting we also officially welcomed our newest Board Members. <strong>Jane Deery</strong>, president of <strong>PGR Media</strong>; <strong>Robin Loporchio</strong>, senior counsel for Intellectual Property &amp; Licensing at <strong>Raytheon Company</strong>; <strong>Andreina Morales</strong>, investment associate and account vice president at <strong>UBS Financial Services, Inc.</strong>; and <strong>Barbara Zack</strong>, controller of Worldwide Field Operations at <strong>Veeco Solar Equipment, Inc.</strong>; joined the 23 existing members of Big Sister Association&rsquo;s Board of Directors. As Board members, Deery, Loporchio, Morales, and Zack are charged with fiscal and strategic oversight of the agency, and play an instrumental role in raising the funds needed to continue creating quality mentoring relationships for more than 3,000 of Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls. In addition to proven leadership skills, these women bring a unique range of professional and philanthropic experience to Big Sister.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAdditionally, we welcomed four new Young Professional Board Members: <strong>Lucy Campbell</strong>, assistant portfolio manager at <strong>The Bank of New York Mellon</strong>; <strong>Maria Fernandes</strong>, government relations specialist at <strong>Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston; Dana Kowalchyk,</strong> development associate at <strong>Raising a Reader</strong>; and <strong>Bianca Whitworth</strong>, associate director of <strong>Boston College&rsquo;s Athletic Department</strong>. Big Sister&rsquo;s Young Professional Board was established to further our reach and connect with the next generation of philanthropists. This diverse group of under-40 leaders is charged with engaging the young professional community of Boston in Big Sister&rsquo;s volunteer and fundraising activities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Our new Board Members will help us raise the funds and awareness needed to continue providing our city&rsquo;s girls with quality mentoring services,&rdquo; said Deborah Re, chief executive officer of Big Sister Association of Greater Boston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2009Board1.jpg\" style=\"line-height:20.8px; margin:10px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><span style=\"font-size:11px\">Deborah Re welcomes our new Board Members</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2009Board2.jpg\" style=\"margin:10px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><em>Deborah Re and Paul Grogan, President and<br />\r\nCEO of The Boston Foundation</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2009Board3.jpg\" style=\"margin:10px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:11px\"><em>New Young Professional Board Members Bianca Whitworth and Maria Fernandes</em></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2009Board4.jpg\" style=\"margin:10px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"font-size:10px\"><em>Stephanie Lee (far right) announces the Verizon Foundation&#39;s $15,000 grant to Big Sister</em></span></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 16:00:45 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"May, 19 2009 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Meet our newest Board Members, who will help raise funds and awareness to support Greater Boston's girls","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":333,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":333,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 04 2016 09:47:17 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/2009Board3.jpg?w180-h180-x19-y0","author":"","title":"Big Sister Welcomes New Board Members at Annual Meeting","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Click on the cover below to download our 2008 Annual Report. &nbsp;Learn about why gender-specific mentoring is necessary, the innovations and achievements seen at Big Sister this past year, demographics of the girls we serve, and enjoy match stories that show the positive impact a Big Sister has on her Little Sister&#39;s life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"//bigsister.files.stage4.getfused.com/file/2008-Annual-Report-6209.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Annual-Report-2008-Cover.png\" /></a></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 15:54:15 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"May, 18 2009 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Big Sister served more girls than ever before in 2008.

Guests put generosity at the top of the menu, the chefs cooked up a special surprise, and a former Big and Little Sister added a dash of inspiration. The result was nearly $120,000 to support Big Sister&rsquo;s mentoring programs for Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn an economic climate when many restaurants are closing their doors, <strong>Esti Parsons</strong>, <strong>Christopher Myers </strong>and <strong>Michael Schlow</strong> generously opened Radius&rsquo;s doors to Big Sister once again this year. Boston&rsquo;s hottest chefs also gave up their one night off, on the heels of a busy Restaurant Week, to lend their gastronomic genius to the evening. Our 120 guests enjoyed a cocktail hour with amuse bouche, followed by a six-course meal that included halibut en croute with coconut rice, braised Asian greens, curry emulsion and wasabi oil; Yorkshire pig terrine with pickled green almonds, ramps, and Dijon pur&eacute;e; and a grand finale of peach melba panna cotta with roasted peaches, raspberry sorbet and thyme syrup. The dishes were prepared by<strong> Ting Yen of Oishii</strong>, <strong>Jamie Bissonette</strong> and <strong>David Hamilton of Toro</strong>, <strong>Marc Orfaly of Marco and Pigalle</strong>, <strong>Mike Pagliarini of Via Matta</strong>, and <strong>Matthew Audette</strong> and <strong>Janessa Tomshick of Radius.</strong>&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMichael Schlow warmly welcomed guests, acknowledging how important their support of the event was this year and that it showed a true commitment to Big Sister and Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls. He then handed over the evening to emcee, <strong>Mish Michaels, of WBZ TV</strong>. Like Esti, Christopher, and Michael, Mish has been a long-time supporter of Big Sister. A Big Sister herself for ten years, Mish now serves on our Advisory Board and hosts activities for our Big and Little Sisters such as a Wachusett Mountain ski trip and a visit to the Blue Hill Observatory.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs stomachs began to fill up, guests were treated to a taste of something not on the menu&mdash;the impact of the work we do. <strong>Former Little Sister Sandra Faioes</strong>, who now teaches at The Engineering School in Hyde Park, and her former Big Sister, <strong>Meg McMillen</strong>, who is a teacher at Quincy High School, have shared more than 20 years of friendship. Sandra explained that growing up in a working class immigrant family in Dorchester she did most things for herself at an early age, including signing up for a Big Sister. While at 12 years old she may not have completely understood what she signed up for, at 33 she knows that what she got was a friend for life. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine what my life would be like without Meg. That&rsquo;s like trying to imagine life without an arm,&rdquo; she told guests. &ldquo;Meg to me is like family, but without the negatives,&rdquo; Sandra joked.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe evening concluded with the Matchmaker Challenge&hellip;and a surprise challenge from the chefs! During the Matchmaker Challenge guests are asked to give $1,000&mdash;the average cost of making and supporting a Big and Little Sister match. With approximately 200 girls on our waiting list at any given time, the generosity of those who give through the Matchmaker Challenge allows us to place a caring, supportive woman in the life of many of those girls. During the Challenge guests read about Catarina, age 8, from Cambridge who said &ldquo;When I grow up I want to be a business lady. That means I want to be a lawyer or help people out and I&rsquo;d get to carry a briefcase. That&rsquo;s kind of cool. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to carry one of those. Also, I would make a lot of money so I can buy three cats.&rdquo; Then there was the wise-beyond-her-years Kerry, age 15, from Dedham, who said &ldquo;When I grow up I want to do something with funeral services or hospice care because I figure most of the Baby Boomer generation will be sick or dying by the time I&rsquo;m old enough to have a career. I don&rsquo;t want to do any embalming though!&rdquo; And then there was Stacia, age 11, from Dorchester, who said, &ldquo;I want a Big Sister because my sister and I don&rsquo;t get along very well and my mom is sick a lot so she can&rsquo;t take me out to do things. I want to have someone to do fun things with, like roller skating and dancing.&rdquo; Michael Schlow and the other chefs were so inspired by these girls and their need for a Big Sister that they decided to sweeten the pot. They offered a meal for four at each of their restaurants to anyone who gave $10,000. Two guests immediately accepted the challenge.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNow that the dishes are washed and the wine glasses put away, we would like to extend a big thank you to all who contributed and made this a successful event. Additionally, we would like to thank the event chair, <strong>Board Member Lisa Scannell</strong>; hosts Esti Parsons, Christopher Myers, and Michael Schlow; all of the chefs who gave their time and talent; emcee, Mish Michaels; and speakers Sandra Faioes and Meg McMillen. We look forward to breaking bread with you again next year at the Celebrity Chef Dinner!</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb1.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb2.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb3.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb4.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb5.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb6.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb7.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb8.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb9.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb10.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb11.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb12.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb13.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb14.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb15.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb16.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb17.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb18.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb19.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb20.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb21.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb22.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb23.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb24.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb25.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb26.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb27.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb28.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb29.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb30.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb31.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb32.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb33.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb34.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb35.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb36.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb37.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb38.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb39.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb40.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb41.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb42.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb43.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb44.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb45.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb46.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb47.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb48.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb49.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb50.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb51.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb52.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb53.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb54.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb55.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb60.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb61.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb62.jpg\"},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Celeb63.j

also one that has elicited myriad reactions (&quot;A Disturbia of dating violence,&quot; editorial, March 19). The results of the Boston Public Health Commission&#39;s survey on the topic brought our city to the forefront of national news. While we must seize the opportunity to keep the dialogue about this public health issue open, we must also be careful not to condemn teens for their opinions. If we rush to say, &quot;How on earth could you blame the victim here?&quot; youth will hear judgment and will shut down; we will miss the opportunity to listen - a necessary condition to changing attitudes and behavior.

And that&rsquo;s what a Big Sister does,&rdquo; said MacDonnell.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe inspiration continued as <strong>Wayne Ashley</strong>, a single father from Dorchester, took the stage. &nbsp;He spoke about the incredible impact Big Sister Association has had on his family by matching each of his three daughters with her own Big Sister more than a year ago. &nbsp;Mr. Ashley painted a picture of the challenges surrounding his daughters who range in age from nine to 12. &nbsp;He spoke candidly about his their peers&rsquo; experimentation with drugs and sex, and the violence his family has witnessed in their own backyard. &nbsp;He also spoke to the less obvious challenges of raising girls while being &ldquo;clueless about the girlie stuff&rdquo; his daughters are beginning to discover, such as boys, make-up, and the changes that come with puberty. &nbsp;Finally, he addressed the biggest challenge of all: &nbsp;supporting each of his daughters as they grieved the loss of their mother, who passed away just one month after the girls were matched with their Big Sisters. &nbsp;Each Big Sister supported her Little Sister as she grieved in her own way. &nbsp;As the bonds of friendship continued to grow between the Ashley girls and their Big Sisters, it was clear that each Big Sister was uniquely suited to the needs of her Little Sister. &nbsp;Mr. Ashley noted our social workers&rsquo; commitment to finding the right match for all our Little Sisters when he said, &ldquo;If any of [my] girls were matched with any of each other&rsquo;s Big Sisters, it just would not have worked. &nbsp;What were the chances of matching all three of my girls and each with the perfect Big Sister too?&rdquo; &nbsp;This was a sentiment his daughters echoed when they took the stage with their Big Sisters to share why each is the perfect one for her.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nRise &amp; Inspire concluded with Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Deborah Re</strong>, asking guests to financially support Big Sister&rsquo;s mentoring programs for girls. &nbsp;A roomful of inspired guests generously gave a total of nearly $46,000.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe would like to extend a &ldquo;big&rdquo;

Our organization has taken steps to address this growing concern, in much the same way that our programs aim to prevent violence, bullying, drug and alcohol usage, teen pregnancy, and dropping out of school.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe have partnered with wellness-minded organizations such as <strong>Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare Foundation</strong>, Healthworks, Dorchester-based <strong>Stajez Center for the Arts</strong>, and <strong>The Women&rsquo;s Sports Foundation&rsquo;s GoGirlGo! </strong>program to promote more physical activities for our Big and Little Sister matches and provide funding for healthy food options at events we host for them.

The evening of November 13 entertained, informed, and inspired an audience of more than 400 guests at the Boston Opera House. <strong>It also raised $575,000&mdash;a record amount&mdash;for Big Sister Association of Greater Boston&rsquo;s mentoring programs for girls!</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAn all-star cast included <strong>The Honorable Mayor Thomas Menino</strong>; Co-chairs <strong>Jack Connors, Jr</strong>. and <strong>Karen Kaplan</strong>; Big Sister&rsquo;s Board President, <strong>Tim O&rsquo;Brien</strong>; Big Sister&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer, <strong>Deborah Re</strong>; and the stars of the show, our Big and Little Sisters. <strong>Big Sister Charmain Jackman </strong>and her <strong>Little Sister, Tichina</strong>&mdash;who have been matched for three and a half years&mdash;welcomed the audience, followed shortly by <strong>Little Sister Kaitlyn</strong>. Kaitlyn&rsquo;s Big Sister, <strong>Elena Proakis Ellis</strong>, along with<strong> Big Sisters April Cook</strong>, <strong>Amanda Song</strong>, and <strong>Kate Potter</strong>, were recognized that evening as our Big Sisters of the Year. From the stage, Little Sister Kaitlyn told guests what makes her friendship with her Big Sister so special, &ldquo;When I first met Elena, I liked her. Now I can honestly say, I don&rsquo;t just like her, I love her&hellip;I want to thank her for always being my friend and showing me that she will always be there for me.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThose in attendance also enjoyed a spectacular dance routine by some of our Big and Little Sisters and performers from the <strong>Stajez Dance</strong> <strong>Troupe</strong>. Under the direction of Stajez Founder and Executive Director, <strong>Sophia Haynes-Cardwell</strong>, our Big and Little Sister matches spent more than a month learning a hip hop-influenced dance routine that they debuted that evening. Their hard work paid off with a flawless, high-energy performance and a standing ovation from the audience.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nTo wrap up the show, <strong>former Little Sister Donna Thach </strong>took the stage. Now 26 years old, Donna first met her <strong>Big Sister Jane Sander</strong> when she was 12. Donna and her family emigrated from Vietnam to Quincy, Massachusetts when she was just six years old. Though her parents had run a successful business back in Vietnam, they struggled to find decent-paying jobs in the United States. Donna grew up in a home that was supportive and loving, but where English was not spoken and connecting with the American culture was difficult. Her Big Sister Jane formed a bridge between the world Donna was coming from and the one in which she now lived. Their friendship grew into a lifelong bond, and Donna and Jane, who is now 85 years old and was in attendance at Big in Boston, remain close friends.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Several years ago I tried to explain to my mother the role that Jane has played in my life as my Big Sister. I don&rsquo;t know if she understood because the word &lsquo;mentor&rsquo; did not translate. For me Jane has been so many things&mdash;a mentor, yes, but also a teacher, a guide, a support, a friend, a confidant, and an ally, and she will always be my Big Sister,&rdquo; Donna told the audience. &ldquo;Other Little Sisters may share my story, many have their own, but the profound impact of having a Big Sister is felt by all of us. No matter what her story is, every girl deserves the friendship, guidance, and attention of a Big Sister.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Our Little Sisters, like Donna and Kaitlyn, were undoubtedly the stars of the show,&rdquo; said <strong>Deborah Re</strong>. &ldquo;They made it clear how their special friendships with their Big Sisters are having a positive impact on their lives; they made it clear why we all need to make mentoring matter.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen the curtain was raised at the end of the program, guests were invited on stage for a delicious buffet dinner and dancing to the sounds of the all-female band, Zili Misik. &nbsp;It was a night to remember thanks to our <a href=\"#CoChairs\"><strong>Co-chairs and Host Committee</strong></a>, and the generosity of those individuals and corporations who made Big in Boston possible. Big Sister would like to extend a special thank you to our <a href=\"#Box Seat\"><strong>Box Seat</strong></a>, <a href=\"#Orchestra\"><strong>Orchestra</strong></a>, and <strong><a href=\"#Mezzanine\">Mezzanine</a> level sponsors</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe would also like to thank all those who attended and we look forward to seeing you again next year at an even bigger and better Big in Boston!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Producers:&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em><a id=\"CoChairs\" name=\"CoChairs\"></a>Co-Chairs</em></strong><br />\r\nJack Connors, <em>The Connors Family Office</em><br />\r\nKaren Kaplan, <em>Hill Holliday</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>The Directors:<br />\r\n<em>Honorary Host Committee</em></strong><br />\r\nThe Honorable Thomas M.

said Charlotte. &quot;Their Big Sisters give them a new perspective on life.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn July 2007, Aunjalee was matched with Big Sister Phyllis Thomas. &nbsp;As the oldest of four brothers and two sisters, Phyllis knew what it meant to be a role model. &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m used to people depending on me,&quot; said Phyllis. &nbsp;Perhaps that is why she recognizes the importance of playing a consistent role in Aunjalee&#39;s life as her mentor and friend; though she admits that the training she received as part of the process of becoming a Big Sister also greatly prepared her.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen Phyllis and Aunjalee were first matched, Phyllis could see that her Little Sister lacked confidence in herself. &nbsp;Aunjalee would often get upset if she didn&#39;t perform well in school or feel defeated when she didn&#39;t understand her math homework. &nbsp;Phyllis encouraged Aunjalee to talk with her about the problems she was having at school and helped put her worries in perspective. &nbsp;She made sure her Little Sister knew that even when she faced set-backs, the most important thing was to never, ever give up. Soon, Phyllis began to notice that Aunjalee&#39;s confidence in her schoolwork was increasing. &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;m not nervous to start a new grade in school now,&quot; said Aunjalee of Phyllis&#39; influence on her. &nbsp;In fact, Aunjalee has gained so much confidence in her academic abilities that she has her sights set on Harvard (class of 2020!).<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs their friendship grows and thrives, Phyllis continues to build Aunjalee&#39;s confidence by encouraging her Little Sister to try new things-whether it is simply eating broccoli at dinner one night or going for walks and bike rides together to encourage Aunjalee to lead a more active lifestyle. &nbsp;Most importantly, Phyllis is always there to lend an ear and her undivided attention to her Little Sister. &nbsp;&quot;She understands me,&quot; said Aunjalee. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAunjalee&#39;s friendship with Phyllis has already shaped her world in so many ways and will continue to broaden her horizons. &nbsp;As for what the future holds, according to the matter-of-fact Aunjalee, &quot;I&#39;ll grow up to have a nice life because of being with my Big Sister Phyllis.&quot;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 12:18:50 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 01 2008 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":314,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":314,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:25:26 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Phyll-and-Aunj.jpg?w196-h196-x45-y30","author":"","title":"All in the Family: Big Sister Phyllis Thomas & Little Sister Aunjalee","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Maria-Mich.jpg\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Whether performing it or simply listening to it, a love of music is what shapes the bond between Big Sister Maria Bautista and her Little Sister Michaela. &nbsp;It is their musical appreciation that has opened their eyes (and ears!) to new things and built a common ground for their deep friendship. &nbsp;Since they were matched in May of 2003, Michaela has hit many high notes in her life and several low notes as well, but through it all the steady rhythm has been her Big Sister Maria.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMichaela is already a talented signer and her Big Sister, who plays the guitar, has inspired Michaela to think about adding an instrument to her repertoire as well. &nbsp;&quot;Maria gives me a lot of confidence in my singing ability,&quot; said Michaela. &nbsp;Though Michaela seeks to become a professional singer, this savvy 16 year old realizes that the odds of becoming the next American Idol are slim. &nbsp;Her non-musical career plans include becoming a medical assistant or even an obstetrician. &nbsp;&quot;I always support what she wants to do and I hope that she does try to achieve her dreams,&quot; said Maria of her Little Sister&#39;s career aspirations. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen not performing music themselves, Maria and Michaela enjoy listening to it. &nbsp;One of their favorite activities is downloading music and making mix CDs to sing along to while driving around in Maria&#39;s car. &nbsp;Their varying tastes in tunes have created a mutual appreciation for new kinds of music. &nbsp;Maria, a fan of oldies and classical, has introduced her Little Sister to some of her favorites from those genres, while Michaela has shared her love of reggae, rap, and R&amp;B with her Big Sister. &nbsp;The two have also enjoyed going to see musicals together such as Little Shop of Horrors and Rent.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHaving a consistent presence like Maria in her life has not only broadened Michaela&#39;s horizons, it also made her more confident and mature. &nbsp;Michaela is no longer shy about raising her hand in class, nor does she feel that she is not as smart as other students. &nbsp;She is more willing to share her feelings, particularly with her Big Sister. &nbsp;&quot;I can tell her stuff that I wouldn&#39;t tell my mother,&quot; said Michaela. &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t even need a diary.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMichaela knows that her Big Sister will always be there when she needs her most, which has helped her through some very trying times. &nbsp;Little Sister Michaela has suffered several losses in the five years she has been matched with Maria. &nbsp;Through both the passing of her grandmother and the killing of a close family friend, Maria offered comfort and support to her Little Sister.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nYet another &quot;loss&quot; came for Michaela when her biological older sister got married and started a family of her own. &nbsp;Michaela missed her sister&#39;s companionship, but found that her Big Sister Maria filled that void and more. &nbsp;&quot;You could never find another Big Sister like mine. &nbsp;I know we&#39;ll be friends forever!&quot; said Michaela.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThough Michaela may not yet know if her future holds a medical or musical career, she does know that it holds a strong, supportive friendship with Maria-and that is music to her ears.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 12:22:48 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 01 2008 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":315,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":315,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:26:24 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Maria-Mich.jpg?w160-h160-x53-y31","author":"","title":"The Soundtrack to Friendship: Big Sister Maria Bautista & Little Sister Michaela","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Click on any of the photos below to read more about how each Big Sister is inspiring confidence, competence, and caring in her Little Sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"/news-and-events/news/the-soundtrack-to-friendship-big-sister-maria-bautista-and-little-sister-michaela-315\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Maria-Mich.jpg\" /></a><a href=\"/news-and-events/news/tea-for-two-big-sister-dina-pradel-and-little-sister-shanice-312\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Dina.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><a href=\"/news-and-events/news/all-in-the-family-big-sister-phyllis-thomas-and-little-sister-aunjalee-314\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Phyll-and-Aunj.jpg\" /></a></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 12:25:43 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 01 2008 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Discover how Big Sisters all over Greater Boston are changing lives one Little Sister at a time","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":316,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":316,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 11:58:26 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Phyll-and-Aunj.jpg?w189-h189-x47-y35","author":"","title":"Get to know some of our Big and Little Sisters","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Nearly four years ago, Little Sister Shanice felt trapped by boredom, confined to her home and Roxbury neighborhood. &nbsp;She knew there was a wealth of activities and places to visit around her, but without someone to show her these opportunities they seemed out of her reach. &nbsp;Shanice&#39;s great-grandmother Charlotte, with whom she was living, saw her frustration and decided to have Shanice matched with a Big Sister. &nbsp;That decision marked the beginning of a new chapter in Shanice&#39;s life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Soon, Shanice and Big Sister Dina were exploring all that Boston has to offer. &nbsp;They went to Celtics games, painted pottery, and watched scary movies together. &nbsp;They started a tradition of &quot;Girls&#39; Days,&quot; which meant going to their favorite South End pizza parlor, Emelio&#39;s, and then getting their nails done at the nearby salon. &nbsp;Now they continue to make plans for future excursions, such as sleepovers and a visit to the Black Heritage Trail.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Though they have shared many experiences in their time together, Big and Little Sister agree that their favorite outing was a trip to the Taj Boston Hotel for afternoon tea. &nbsp;Dina often enjoyed going to the Taj for tea with her girlfriends and thought Shanice might like it as well. &nbsp;The afternoon was not only an exciting new experience for Shanice, but an intense bonding session for the two. &nbsp;Shanice had a lot on her mind that day, and when they sat down to tea, she opened up to her Big Sister and they talked for hours. &nbsp;Times like this have been an exercise in truly listening for Dina. &nbsp;Though she is often tempted to give advice at every turn, she said that her experience with Shanice has taught her the value of sometimes just listening.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, one piece of wisdom Dina has shared with her Little Sister is that it takes hard work and a stick-to-it attitude to achieve your goals. &nbsp;While she hopes Shanice will apply this advice to her future goal of becoming a doctor or a dentist, Dina has already seen her Little Sister demonstrate a strong sense of determination. &nbsp;Last winter, Dina and Shanice attended Big Sister Association&#39;s annual ski trip to Wachussett Mountain. &nbsp; Shanice had never skied before, but according to Dina, &quot;She just barreled down that hill and didn&#39;t look back. &nbsp;Even when she fell, she popped right back up and kept going.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Shanice prepares to enter high school this fall, Dina hopes the confidence and resilience she showed on the slopes will transfer into her academic life. &nbsp;Thanks to the support she has received from her Big Sister, Shanice is sure it will. &nbsp;&quot;I am actually confident about going to high school now,&quot; said Shanice. &nbsp;In fact, Big Sister Dina&#39;s positive influence on Shanice has been so evident, that her great-grandmother Charlotte signed up another of her great-grandaughters for a Big Sister too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Dina.jpg\" /></p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 12 2016 12:11:10 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"September, 01 2008 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":312,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":312,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:26:40 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Dina.jpg?w159-h159-x79-y28","author":"","title":"Tea for Two: Big Sister Dina Pradel & Little Sister Shanice","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>On August 14, it was as if Mother Nature knew there was a beach party to be had.

merits front page above- the-fold news. As the head of a mentoring organization that is committed to remaining gender-specific, it was encouraging to read that both the Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings and our Superintendent Carol Johnson see the value of single-sex education. &nbsp;As Spellings was quoted as saying &ldquo;I&rsquo;m all about things that get results.&rdquo; And, isn&rsquo;t that what we want for our children, results? Girls and boys face different social, emotional, and developmental challenges as they navigate their way through childhood and adolescence to become self-sufficient adults. The divergence of achievement and graduation rates among boys and girls alone, (as the article points out) suggests that traditional methods and classroom environments need responsible and continuous reassessment. &nbsp;It is incumbent upon us as leaders, teachers, policy makers, parents, and citizens who care about our children, to create learning opportunities, both in school and in the community, which foster the healthy development of our children. At Big Sister, we do just that. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nResearch shows that focusing on gender gets results. After a 3-year study of the impact of gender in mentoring, Jean Rhodes, Professor of Psychology at the University of Massachusetts in Boston says &ldquo;Our research suggests that girls and boys who are referred to youth mentoring programs face different sets of challenges and have different developmental needs. Consequently, they are likely to be better served in programs that are specifically geared to meet those needs and challenges. Indeed, to the extent that mentoring programs incorporate gender-specific training and awareness, volunteers are likely to be more effective agents of change.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We train our Big Sisters on how to address the specific developmental needs of adolescent girls and continue to support them in this area throughout their relationship with a girl (Little Sister). &nbsp;As a result, our Little Sisters show marked improvement in their self-esteem, academic performance, relationships with peers and adults, and their ability to avoid delinquency. &nbsp;Now, imagine putting this gender-specific experience in the classroom. &nbsp;Given the specific attention and support they need, girls, and boys, will thrive academically.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gender-specific educational options are not about separating the girls from the boys, but about giving both genders the opportunity to learn in an environment that best meets their individual needs. &nbsp;It IS all about results.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 11 2016 13:45:59 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"May, 12 2008 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Read Big Sister CEO, Deborah Re's, response to the recent Boston Globe article, \"Keeping the boys away from the girls.\"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":304,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":304,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 10:04:12 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"It's not boys vs. girls","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>On Monday, May 5, a new era was ushered in at Big Sister Association of Greater Boston&rsquo;s Annual Meeting. &nbsp;After three years as president of Big Sister&rsquo;s Board of Directors, Dolores Mitchell, Executive Director of the Group Insurance Commission, passed the presidential torch to <strong>Timothy J.

&nbsp;Though only in its second year, Big in Boston 2007 was the largest fundraising event in Big Sister history and will allow us to provide more girls than ever before with the care and support of a mentor.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe evening was a celebration of friendship and sisterhood: from the group of women known as the Women of Simmons College, who came together to raise an unprecedented $75,000 as the Presenting Sponsor for Big in Boston; to the evening&rsquo;s honorees, Divas Uncorked, a group of African-American women who turned their friendship and love of wine into a thriving start-up venture; to the band, Zili Misik, a diverse group of women who set sisterhood to music; to the special Big in Boston cookies, made by two sisters whose love of baking became a successful business. However, the most meaningful examples of the power of friendship were the Big and Little Sisters who spoke about their relationships during the program, which was emceed by CBS4&rsquo;s Mish Michaels. &nbsp;Current Big and Little Sisters, Elena Proakis Ellis and Kaitlyn, Katie Eagan and Sparkle, Ellen DePaul and Thelma and Angela Johnson and Mariah all spoke to a crowd of nearly 500 guests about the life-changing impact their special friendships have had on their lives.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;When you hear from the Little Sisters like Kaitlyn, Sparkle, Thelma and Mariah, the positive impact that having a mentor has had on their lives is evident,&rdquo; said Deborah Re, Big Sister&rsquo;s Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;It was clear from the outpouring of support for Big in Boston that our community understands why gender-specific mentoring is necessary.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn addition to these current matches, one very special Little Sister, Linda Brennan, gave a moving speech about how her Big Sister Marlene changed her life when they were first matched 44 years ago. &nbsp;&ldquo;Marlene was educated, compassionate and extremely persevering. As I stand here tonight, I can honestly say that Marlene saved my life,&rdquo; Linda told the audience. &nbsp;And just as Marlene had always been there for Linda, she was there to hear Linda speak at Big in Boston&mdash;and to receive a standing ovation from the audience!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs a final showing of support for Greater Boston&rsquo;s girls, guests donated more than $26,000 through our Matchmaker Challenge, hosted by surprise guests, who are &ldquo;big&rdquo; in Boston in their own right, Natalie Jacobson, formerly of Channel 5 fame and Susan Wornick, also of Channel 5. &nbsp;The Matchmaker Challenge allows us to remove from the waiting list Little Sisters who are ready to be matched when donors make a contribution of $1,000&mdash;the average cost of making and supporting a match. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s 26 girls who will now receive the care and support of a Big Sister!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOf course the evening would not have been the success it was without the generosity of all those individuals who donated to the event and Big in Boston&rsquo;s corporate sponsors. &nbsp;We would particularly like to thank the Presenting Sponsor, the <strong>Women of Simmons College</strong>. &nbsp;We would also like to thank <strong>Goodwin Procter</strong>, <strong>The Connors Family</strong>, <strong>Liberty Mutual</strong>, <strong>WilmerHale</strong>, <strong>Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts</strong>, <strong>Tufts Health Plan</strong>, <strong>Bain Capital Children&rsquo;s Charity</strong>, <strong>CitiBank</strong>, <strong>Bank of

no tricks, just plenty of treats on October 31, when Big Sister&rsquo;s Young Professional Group hosted the 3rd annual Wicked Big Pahty at Ned Devine&rsquo;s. The Halloween-themed soiree brought in more than $5,000, which will go toward our mentoring programs for girls. The party also brought in some creative costumes, ranging from 80&rsquo;s icons Rainbow Bright, Hulk Hogan and Mr. T to the more culinary-themed pigs in a blanket and even a box of Dunkin&rsquo; Donuts munchkins!&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWith all the unique costumes it was difficult for the special guest judges, the Celtics dancers, to choose the winners. In the end, &ldquo;Scariest&rdquo; went to a baby boy sporting some 5 o&rsquo;clock shadow, &ldquo;Best Impersonation&rdquo; went to Mr. T, &ldquo;Funniest&rdquo; went to a turkey and &ldquo;Most Creative&rdquo; went to Hulk Hogan.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn addition to all the characters at Wicked Big Pahty, many of our Big Sisters were in attendance as well, and spent the evening enjoying the festivities while talking with other young professionals about being a mentor. They shared stories of all the fun activities they do with their Little Sisters and the good feeling they get from having a positive impact on a girl&rsquo;s life. Several of the guests left wanting to know how they could get more involved with Big Sister!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSpecial thanks are in order to those who are already involved in a &ldquo;big&rdquo; way&mdash;the Wicked Big Pahty co-chairs, Ryan Krouskop and Claudia Silva, as well as the entire Young Professional Group, who planned the spooktacular event.

A writer, a policewoman, a psychologist, a singer or a fashion designer&mdash;these are all careers that the 15 year-old would like to have once she has finished college. While Tracey does not yet know which path she will eventually pursue, she does know that her Big Sister Sherri inspires her to follow her dreams. &nbsp;&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t believe in giving up,&rdquo; says Tracey of her Big Sister. &ldquo;She wanted to go to law school and she did&hellip;she never gave up.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn April of 2006, Little Sister Tracey was matched with Sherri Woodlock, who is currently studying law at Massachusetts School of Law. &nbsp; Already showing signs of being an assertive young woman, Tracey referred herself to Big Sister Association of Greater Boston after hearing about our programs from a family member. Tracey admitted that she didn&rsquo;t have much to do outside of school and wanted someone with whom she could spend time, try new activities and visit new places.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBig Sister&rsquo;s social work staff knew just who to pair the reserved, but upbeat teenager with&mdash;outgoing and adventurous Big Sister Sherri! &nbsp; It was immediately clear that Big and Little Sister complemented each other perfectly. Soon they were busy going to the movies, making pottery, cooking dinners together, bowling and taking a trip to Six Flags amusement park. Over the summer, Sherri even took her Little Sister to her first Red Sox game (after they received tickets from Big Sister Association which were generously donated by The Foundation to Be Named Later). While Tracey was not an immediate baseball fan, she loved the opportunity to go to Fenway Park with her Big Sister and was definitely a fan of the Fenway franks.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLittle Sister Tracey enjoys having someone in her life who expands her social horizons, but more importantly she likes that Sherri is there just for her as a caring, objective friend. &ldquo;I have someone I can talk to and have conversations with,&rdquo; says Tracey of her Big Sister, &ldquo;not just as a Big Sister but also as a friend.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSherri realizes that her friendship is crucial at this stage in Tracey&rsquo;s life. &ldquo;Sometimes it can be a challenge to talk to family and friends and Tracey knows that she has [in me] another person she can talk to,&rdquo; says Sherri.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis fall, Tracey began her freshman year at Brighton High School. As she navigates this time of changes and challenges, she knows that she can rely on her Big Sister Sherri to be there for her every step of the way.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 08 2016 11:59:46 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 11 2007 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Read about how Big Sister Sherri Woodlock inspires her Little Sister Tracey to never give up and learn to appreciate new things...like the Red Sox and Fenway Franks!","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":289,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":289,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:27:43 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Sherri.gif?w159-h159-x1-y0","author":"","title":"Big Sister Sherri Woodlock and Little Sister Tracey","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Molly.gif\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />Little Sister Molly, a spunky, rosy-cheeked 10 year-old, lives in Charlestown with her mother, older sister and brother. Of course Molly will tell you she actually has two big sisters&mdash;her biological sister, Erin, and her Big Sister Amy Rose. However, Erin is more than happy to share her sisterly role with Amy, whom she feels is an important part of not only Molly&rsquo;s life, but the entire family&rsquo;s life as well. While Molly&rsquo;s family is close, her mom works long hours to support them and Molly&rsquo;s sister goes to school and works as well. Molly wanted someone who was there just for her to expand her horizons and just have fun.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMolly found that someone in July of 2005, when she was matched with Big Sister Amy. In a Big Sister, Molly wanted someone she could &ldquo;talk to and play with.&rdquo; In a Little Sister, Amy was looking for a way to have the kind of positive impact on a girl that many women had on her when she was growing up. What they found in each other was a friendship that has allowed them both to have fun and grow. Amy says that spending time with Molly has brought out the kid in her again and Molly credits Amy with teaching her how to be more respectful toward her mom and how to be more confident.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Being a mentor has allowed me to show someone a different life and a different path,&rdquo; says Amy, whose travels around the world have inspired her Little Sister to aspire to one day do the same. For now, the pair keep their journeys local, making trips to New Hampshire&rsquo;s shoreline or a day at their favorite park in Wellesley, but thanks to her Big Sister, Molly has big plans for the future. &ldquo;When I graduate college I am going to go to Paris,&rdquo; asserts Molly. &ldquo;I want to be a pediatrician who travels.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMolly&rsquo;s biological sister, Erin, has already seen positive changes in Molly since Big Sister Amy came into her life more than a year ago. Erin notes that Amy brings out the &ldquo;sporty&rdquo; side in Molly, by teaching her how to play ball and encouraging athletic activities when they are together. &ldquo;Amy makes Molly a very happy person,&rdquo; says Erin. &ldquo;They have a connection that will definitely last a long time and will be a permanent fixture in both their lives.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt is clear that no matter where Molly&rsquo;s travels may eventually take her, she will always know that they began with the special friendship of her Big Sister Amy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 08 2016 12:02:03 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 11 2007 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Following in the footsteps of Big Sister Amy Rose, Little Sister Molly plans to travel the world.","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":290,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":290,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:26:59 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Molly.gif?w158-h158-x2-y1","author":"","title":"Big Sister Amy Rose and Little Sister Molly","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>Big Sisters Amy Rose and Sherri Woodlock are both inspirations to their Little Sisters Molly and Tracey. &nbsp;Find out why by clicking here to read two new match stories from our Community-Based Mentoring program!</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 08 2016 12:03:30 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"October, 11 2007 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":291,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":291,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 04 2016 08:59:02 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"announcements","thumbnailImage":"","author":"","title":"Read About Two of our Community-Based Matches","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p>The new free publication, Skirt!, which focuses on issues affecting women and girls in Boston is hosting a contest for girls ages 5-8. &nbsp;Girls will create a campaign package they would use for themselves if they were to run for president.

mentor to Sophie, 13, a Lincoln School eighth-grader, since November.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd their friendship &mdash; bound by television shows and tensions at home &mdash; has been rewarding in more ways than one.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNaming her mentor as the woman who inspires her for a recent essay contest on the subject, Sophie won first place in her grade level for her writing.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe Cypress Street resident is one of nine students honored tonight, March 29, for their essays at the 15th annual Women Who Inspire Us awards ceremony, hosted by the Brookline Commission for Women.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;It serves an important way for Brookline to chronicle the history of women,&rdquo; said Casey Hatchett, commission chairwoman and a Brookline Police officer.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe commission will also honor its 2007 Woman of the Year, Pat Norling, for her fight to raise awareness about domestic violence.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMore than 150 essayists applied, Hatchett said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very clear from when you read them which ones were more than an assignment for these children,&rdquo; she said.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&lsquo;We bicker like real siblings&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During a recent outgoing to Newbury Street, Napo<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe teen rolled her eyes exaggeratedly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s annoying,&rdquo; she interrupted overdramatically as Napoleon smirked.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;She tells me that all the time,&rdquo; said Napoleon, who lives in Boston&rsquo;s South End.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;But then we laugh,&rdquo; Sophie said with a shy smile and shrug.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;We bicker like real siblings,&rdquo; her &ldquo;Big Sister&rdquo; added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such easygoing chatter and the innocent teasing underscore the essay&rsquo;s message.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;She always puts a smile on my face,&rdquo; Sophie wrote. &ldquo;When we are out in public, she will do something wacky, and it makes me want to be happy all the time.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhile the pair has much happiness to share, Napoleon has also become Sophie&rsquo;s confidante for when things get rough.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;I felt that with difficulties, I guess, at home, I felt like I needed a friend who would always be there,&rdquo; said Sophie, who declined to elaborate. &ldquo;She really accepts who I am.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNapoleon, who faced her own family struggles, said she always makes herself available for Sophie. That comes as a relief to Sophie, who will attend boarding school in New Hampshire next year.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s really corny, but before I met Claire, I was kind of a shy person and I didn&rsquo;t really speak what I felt,&rdquo; Sophie said. &ldquo;She kind of made me realize it&rsquo;s OK to do that.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&lsquo;She&rsquo;s an angel&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It seems the nightmare for Jabrill Bowden, 12, is nearly over.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEarly in his childhood, the Department of Social Services separated him from his six siblings and tossed him into an institution, said grandmother Catherine Harris.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHarris fought to rescue him from the state agency and finally gained custody of Jabrill and his brother in 2005.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBut it was not just separation that traumatized him, said Harris, an Egmont Street resident. Citing &ldquo;behavioral problems,&rdquo; state workers forced her grandson to take antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs that made him hallucinate, she said.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHe has recently returned from a three-month stay at a clinic in Dorchester to help stop the medications; Jabrill has also since been diagnosed with pervasive developmental delays.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;He was thinking the world had ended for him,&rdquo; said Harris, who Jabrill wrote about last year in the &ldquo;Women Who Inspire Us&rdquo; essay contest last year, taking home first place.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlthough Harris tirelessly advocates for her grandson, she cannot be everywhere.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThat is where his classroom aide at the Devotion School, Mary Puccia, 27, came in.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;She helps me during the day, she takes me bike riding and she doesn&rsquo;t have to, and when I&rsquo;m feeling down, she helps me with that,&rdquo; said Jabrill, a sixth-grader at Devotion. &ldquo;God sent her into my life for a special reason. She&rsquo;s an angel.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn his second consecutive win, this time in second place, Jabrill named Puccia as the woman who inspires him.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;In history class, sometimes I feel like I want to burst out laughing or be disruptive. She always knows how to calm me down,&rdquo; he wrote in the essay.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;She always helps me and comforts me when I have centipede hallucinations.&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAdditionally, Puccia rewards Jabrill&rsquo;s good behavior with bike rides at Amory Park, trips to Good Time Emporium in Somerville and dinners out.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nPuccia, who said working with Jabrill inspired her to pursue social work, doesn&rsquo;t see herself as extraordinary.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for me to think I&rsquo;m really some exceptional person,&rdquo; the Roslindale resident said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>The Brookline Commission for Women will honor their Woman of the Year and &ldquo;Women Who Inspire Us&rdquo; essay contest winners Thursday, March 29, 6:45-8:30 p.m., at Hunneman Hall in the Brookline Public Library, 361 Washington St.<br />\r\nJessica Scarpati can be reached at jscarpat@cnc.com.</em><br />\r\n------</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Essay winners<br />\r\nSixth grade</strong><br />\r\nFirst place: Lily Waldron, Baker School<br />\r\nSecond place: Jabrill Bowden, Devotion School<br />\r\nThird place: Jancarlos Aguasvivas, Lawrence School</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Seventh grade</strong><br />\r\nFirst place: Michela Moscufo, Lincoln School<br />\r\nSecond place: Maya Midzik, Lincoln School<br />\r\nThird place: Alison Rowe, Runkle School</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eighth grade</strong><br />\r\nFirst place: Sophie Pearl, Lincoln School<br />\r\nSecond place: Katherine Kim, Baker School<br />\r\nThird place: Wilson Neal, Lincoln School<br />\r\nleon, a music teacher in Braintree schools who volunteers with the Big Sister Association of Greater Boston, talked about how she has tried to introduce Sophie to more classical music.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 08 2016 10:20:31 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"March, 29 2007 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Little Sister Sophie wins a local essay contest for writing about the woman who inspires her--Big Sister Claire Napoleon!","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":274,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":274,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"May, 03 2016 10:00:17 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"pressCoverage","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Sophie.gif?w261-h261-x0-y2","author":"","title":"Little Sister Sophie Wins Women Who Inspire Us Essay Contest","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"},{"detailPageUrlText":"Read More","detail":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Charlotte.gif\" style=\"float:right; margin:10px\" />&ldquo;Instantly compatible.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how Little Sister Charlotte&rsquo;s mom describes the relationship between her daughter and Big Sister Colleen Kenney. As the middle child of a large family&mdash;two older sisters and two younger brothers&mdash;living in South Boston, Charlotte&rsquo;s mom felt that her youngest daughter needed someone who was available &ldquo;just for her, someone she doesn&rsquo;t have to share.&rdquo; From the moment they met, it was clear that Colleen was that someone.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOver the next couple of years Colleen and Charlotte spent time together attending sporting events, going to the movies and often just talking. They also liked to cook for each other. Colleen soon learned that Charlotte had a passion for cooking and often helped her mother cook special meals for the family. Knowing of Charlotte&rsquo;s interest in the culinary arts, Colleen decided to sign the two up as volunteers at Big Sister&rsquo;s annual fundraising event held at downtown restaurant, Radius.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nCharlotte spent her time at Radius preparing for the event, but what she really wanted was a chance to &ldquo;get her hands dirty&rdquo; in the kitchen. When the staff at Radius learned of Charlotte&rsquo;s enthusiasm for cooking they invited her back for an afternoon of hands-on culinary experience. Not only did Charlotte have the opportunity to prep the herbs for that night&rsquo;s meal, learn knife skills and get to watch professional chefs in action, she also learned to love a food she never thought she could&hellip;mushrooms!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen one of the chefs learned of her aversion to mushrooms, he became determined to find a way for her to like them. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he did with them, but it was the best thing I ever tried,&rdquo; said Charlotte. &ldquo;I eat them all the time now!&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAfter that day, fueled by Colleen&rsquo;s encouragement, Charlotte continued to pursue her culinary dreams. In the fall of 2006, Charlotte entered a unique program at Johnson &amp; Wales College of Culinary Arts in Rhode Island. While still considered a senior at her own high school&mdash;able to go to prom and graduate with her class&mdash;Charlotte is also spending the year as a freshman at Johnson &amp; Wales so that she can get a head start on her culinary career.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBig Sister Colleen could not be more proud of Charlotte&rsquo;s achievements. &ldquo;Charlotte is wonderful. She has such a good sense of who she is, she doesn&rsquo;t want to be Rachel Ray, she just wants her own little place or to run a catering business where she can create her own menu and be her own boss,&rdquo; says Colleen.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAccording to Charlotte&rsquo;s mom, her daughter might not have followed her passion had it not been for Colleen&rsquo;s influence. &ldquo;Colleen has given Charlotte a lot of confidence, helping her to think about fulfilling her dreams and knowing that she can succeed.&rdquo;<br />\r\nOn June 3, 2007, Charlotte&#39;s dreams will come full-circle, as she returns to Radius as a special &quot;guest chef&quot; &nbsp;to help prepare one of the courses for this year&#39;s Celebrity Chef event.</p>\r\n","metaTitle":"","youtubeId":"","gallery":"[]","isOriginService":1,"previewUrl":"","metaKeywords":"","contentDefinitionTitle":"News","dateCreated":"April, 08 2016 10:11:30 +0000","typeOld":"","publishDate":"January, 01 2007 00:00:00 +0000","metaDescription":"","abstract":"Read about how Big Sister Colleen Kenney fostered Little Sister Charlotte's dreams of becoming a chef all the way to Johnson & Wales College of Culinary Arts!","serviceId":2,"contentStatusTitle":"Live","detailPageUrl":"","subtitle":"","sourceName":"","lastModifiedBy":"gfplatform@getfused.com","overrideUrl":"","originalContentId":273,"popNewWindow":0,"createdBy":"","sourceUrl":"","download":"","contentId":273,"contentDefinitionName":"news","lastModified":"April, 02 2018 13:27:15 +0000","systemName":"","image":"","expireDate":"","type":"sisterSpotlights","thumbnailImage":"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Charlotte.gif?w159-h159-x0-y5","author":"","title":"Big Sister Colleen Kenney and Little Sister Charlotte","contentDefinitionId":17,"serviceName":"www","contentStatusId":1,"contentStatusName":"live"}],
