      "detail": "<p>Earlier this month, we were proud to receive the Gold Standard award from the Big Brothers Big Sisters of America Nationwide Leadership Council; a testament to the high quality and service excellence we provide to more than 2,200 Sister matches annually. There are more than 350 Big Brothers Big Sisters agencies in the United States, all of which share the same goals, compliance regulations, and expectations. The award is based on data, and those numbers tell a story. But it&rsquo;s not the only story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last Saturday we hosted our annual Appreciation Breakfast for nearly 350 Big and Little Sisters. It was at that breakfast where we heard stories directly from the girls whose lives have been impacted in so many ways by their relationships with their Big Sisters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In front of all these women and girls, one Little Sister said that her best memory were all her memories of spending time with her Big Sister.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One young girl confidently took the microphone in her hand, looked the audience in the eyes and said &ldquo;I love her.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We heard the story of a former Little Sister who tried skiing because she trusted her Big Sister and continued pushing herself out of her comfort zone--and still does--as she helps strengthen relationships between Big and Little Sisters as one of our staff members today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We could not achieve this Gold Standard recognition or hear these stories of transformation without the support of you, our Big Sister Boston community. Thank you for helping us achieve this honor: for Greater Boston&#39;s girls, for the women who step up as Big Sisters, and for the health of our beloved community.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><span>In 2005, Emily Boone had been a social worker at Big Sister Boston for more than a year. She had earned her master&rsquo;s degree in social work and felt stable and fulfilled in her personal life and her career. At work, she guided, supported, and shared resources with her caseload of Big Sisters, Little Sisters, and their families in our Community-Based Mentoring program. When she decided to seek out a volunteer opportunity, she did not have far to look.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"line-height:20.8px\">\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Blog-Elizabeth1.jpg?rs30\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\">Little Sister Elizabeth with Big Sister Emily at a Red Sox game in 2009.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<div>That same year, Little Sister Elizabeth entered the third grade at the Hurley K-8 School, a Spanish-English immersion school in Boston&rsquo;s South End. Though she liked school, Elizabeth struggled with the rigorous demands of a bi-lingual curriculum and was at risk of repeating third grade. At home, Elizabeth was the youngest of four children, but there was a large age gap between Elizabeth and her three older brothers. Her parents, who had immigrated with her brothers to the United States from the Dominican Republic years before, spoke limited English. Elizabeth&rsquo;s mother had some schooling; her father left school after the fourth grade to work on his family&rsquo;s farm. They prioritized education for their children, but found it challenging to understand parent-teacher conferences and intricacies of the school system. Elizabeth often found herself translating for her parents and advocating on her own behalf.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Big Sister Boston had forged an on-going partnership with the Hurley School as part of our Site-Based Mentoring Program. When Elizabeth&rsquo;s teacher asked the girls in the class if they were interested in having Big Sisters, Elizabeth&rsquo;s hand shot up in the air. Following an assessment interview of both Emily and Elizabeth by one of Big Sister Boston&rsquo;s enrollment and matching specialists, 27 year-old Emily and 9 year-old Elizabeth were matched as Big and Little Sister. Despite her strong familiarity with the process, Emily was still impressed with the decision to pair her with Elizabeth. &ldquo;Our social worker&rsquo;s name was Jessica and she did a really good job matching us,&rdquo; said Emily. &ldquo;I remember Jessica asking me good questions,&rdquo; Elizabeth recalls. During their first visit at the Hurley, Emily and Elizabeth made beaded necklaces for each other. Ten years later both women still have the necklaces; a reminder of how a lasting friendship began.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Blog-Elizabeth2.jpg?rs26\" style=\"line-height:20.8px; text-align:center\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\">A recent drawing by Little Sister Elizabeth depicting one of her favorite activities to do with Emily -<br />\r\nlong chats over freshly baked cookies and tea!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Elizabeth&rsquo;s family saw the positive impact of her relationship with Emily. During their first year together, Elizabeth&rsquo;s brother wrote a letter to Emily while he was away at college, thanking her for looking out for his younger sister and caring so deeply for her. He wrote that Elizabeth&rsquo;s friendship with Emily took away some of the guilt he felt about not being there to support his sister. The next year, Elizabeth proudly went on to fourth grade, and she and her Big Sister Emily transitioned into the Community-Based Mentoring program. The two would go to Emily&rsquo;s apartment to try out new recipes for baked goods, make pottery at a studio in Brookline, or talk over fribbles at Friendly&rsquo;s. Their relationship gave the mature Elizabeth the space she needed to be a kid. &ldquo;I had to grow up fast,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I worked throughout high school to help my family. My friends weren&rsquo;t doing that.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Elizabeth worked hard and was excited at the prospect of attending college like her brothers and her Big Sister, but disappointment struck when she was waitlisted at Emerson College. On top of that, Elizabeth worried about financial aid. After years of looking forward to college, she became discouraged. But, she knew where to turn. Big Sister Emily and her husband joined forces to offer moral support and help Elizabeth develop a financial plan. This past January, Elizabeth entered Emerson College as a freshman.</span>After four years together, Emily&rsquo;s path took her to Connecticut, where she got married and started a family, but her commitment to Elizabeth never faltered. They visited often, talked on the phone, and Emily was always invited to family events. Emily attended Elizabeth&rsquo;s quinceanera, where she was asked to sit at the family table. Elizabeth dedicated one of her 15 candles to her Big Sister and Elizabeth&rsquo;s father recognized Emily in his toast. When Elizabeth graduated from high school, Emily was there to cheer her on and attended the family celebration afterward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned from Emily that it doesn&rsquo;t really matter where you come from or how you grew up, you can build a relationship with someone and learn from them,&rdquo; said the now 19 year-old Elizabeth. &ldquo;I strongly believe our relationship has molded me into the woman I am today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><strong>By Hilary Ross, Program Events Specialist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boston is in the midst of a historic construction boom. New buildings are going up on the Northeastern University campus, gleaming new office towers and apartments are rising at the Seaport, and the new Boston Public Schools administrative building recently opened in Dudley Square. The boom brings a new skyline, opportunities for businesses, and new jobs in the building trade for Boston residents, along with concerns about rental prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since 1980, the city has implemented quotas to ensure building trade jobs are equitably contracted, reflecting the city&rsquo;s diversity. Construction sites must make a good faith effort to contract <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/17/construction-companies-fall-short-boston-goals-for-women-city-residents/QakLUvkubDCw12bEEks7HJ/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent of all jobs to Boston residents</a>, 25 percent to racial and ethnic minority groups, and 10 percent to women. Yet, in 2014, only <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/05/17/construction-companies-fall-short-boston-goals-for-women-city-residents/QakLUvkubDCw12bEEks7HJ/story.html\" target=\"_blank\">4.4 percent of construction site jobs</a> were contracted to women. While companies and the city are working to improve the rate at which women are hired for construction jobs, there&rsquo;s a lack of women in the sector&rsquo;s pipeline.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our partner organizations, <strong>Sisters at Work (S.A.W.)</strong>, is actively changing the landscape by introducing young women to the trades and preparing them for jobs with livable salaries and benefits. The S.A.W. Youth Program is geared toward at-risk young women who reside in Boston neighborhoods, including Roxbury, Dorchester, and Mattapan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This past Saturday, Big Sister Boston and S.A.W. hosted a carpentry and construction activity in Dorchester for Big and Little Sister matches. The day was designed to teach Little Sisters basic carpentry skills and introduce them to careers in the building trades. <strong>Mikey Miles</strong>, carpenter and founder of S.A.W., and<strong> Shamaiah Turner</strong>, a sheet metal worker and volunteer with S.A.W., gathered an inspiring team of women volunteers &ndash; including carpenters, electricians, a contractor, and an interior decorator &ndash; who instructed and led Little Sisters in building and designing their own small wooden chests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon arrival, Big and Little Sisters met the S.A.W. volunteers, who showed them their work stations, including a set of tools and pre-cut wood for each girl. The Little Sisters appeared excited, but apprehensive about the projects before them. As the day went on, their confidence visibly increased as they put their new skills into action. Little Sisters learned to use a drill and a hammer, and successfully built their wooden chest with the guidance of the tradeswomen. If Little Sisters made a mistake, the tradeswomen showed them how to try again or to fix it, a crucial life skill. Once they finished constructing, Big and Little Sisters painted and designed the finished project with the help of an experienced decorator. By the end, each Little Sister had a beautiful, hand-crafted piece to take home and the confidence that comes with learning new skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Blog-Building-Sisterhood1.jpg?rs20\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After a well-deserved lunch, Big and Little Sisters had the chance to learn more about the tradeswomen and hear a bit of their stories. We heard from <strong>Steph Jeffers</strong>, an electrician, who explained how electrical wires are installed. Steph, Shamaiah, and Mikey especially emphasized the importance of studying math and science to enter the building trades. For instance, carpenters regularly do math in their head as they measure wood, sheet metal workers calculate the size of metal, and electricians use physics formulas like Ohm&rsquo;s Law. Steph shared that after high school, she started college and had an office job, but quickly knew that path wasn&rsquo;t for her. She wanted to work with her hands and apply her math and science skills. She discovered a program that introduced her to the trades, and soon took the test to enter an electrician&rsquo;s apprentice program. Today, she&rsquo;s in her fourth year of her apprenticeship &ndash; funded by her union, and on her way to becoming a certified electrician.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;d like to express our thanks to S.A.W. and their volunteers for fundraising to provide the materials, developing the activity, and providing expert guidance. Through partners like <strong>S.A.W.</strong>, Little Sisters can participate in activities that expose them to new skills and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, as always, thank you to our Big Sisters, whose guidance and support help Little Sisters to develop their strengths while exploring options for their futures. If your Little Sister is interested in learning more about careers in the building trades, <strong>S.A.W.</strong> provides summer programming. Additionally, you can check out the <a href=\"http://bostonabcd.org/building-pathways.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Building Pathways</a>: Building Trades Pre-Apprenticeship program, or connect with a local union to learn more about their job opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/SAW.png\" style=\"height:126px; width:175px\" /></p>\r\n",

The inspiring women (and men!) who walked the runway in support of our mission got me thinking not just about those who have made their mark in the past, but those who are making history now. While the national stage may be shining its spotlight on women like Hillary Clinton, there are many women right here in Boston who will go down in the history books, too; women who are showing girls growing up today what&#39;s possible. These women are all role models in their own right, and they are women like Boston City Council President, Michelle Wu, who walked our Project Role Model runway last night and is the first Asian American woman to serve on our city council.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also on that runway? Little Sisters Aniyah, Isabelle, Megan, and two Briannas, accompanied by their Big Sisters. With their trusted, caring mentors by their side, these girls exuded confidence. I couldn&#39;t help but think we might be looking at the next Michelle Wu...or even the next Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is through the continued support of our volunteers, funders, and community partners that we are able to ignite girls&#39; passion and power to succeed; to let them know that anything is possible for them. Let&#39;s make history together.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><strong>Blog post written by Hilary Ross, Program Events Specialist</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This week, <a href=\"http://www.mawomenscaucus.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Members of the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators</a> treated Big and Little Sisters to a tour of the Massachusetts State House. During the day, the women shared an inspiring message with our Little Sisters, and encouraged Big Sisters to reinforce it: &ldquo;You can run for political office one day and win!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, the tour stopped in the Great Hall, which is lined with a flag from nearly every one of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts, a tradition started in the 1990s. Then, our group moved on to the Senate Chambers, and Little Sisters saw where Senators cast their votes. Moving on to the House of Representatives Chambers, Big and Little Sisters learned some amusing trivia: there is a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Cod\" target=\"_blank\">Sacred Cod</a>&rdquo; statue watching over the Chambers that was once stolen by crafty Harvard students. The legislators at the time &ndash; indignant at the thieves&#39; lack of respect &ndash; refused to work until it was returned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After taking in the history of the State House and the stunning architecture, Big and Little Sisters enjoyed a lively Q&amp;A session with Representatives <strong>Michelle Dubois</strong>, <strong>Christine Barber</strong>, and <strong>Denise Provost;</strong> Chief of Staff to Gloria Fox, <strong>Mary-dith Tuitt</strong>, Chief of Staff to Denise Garlick, <strong>Amanda Bernardo </strong>(who is also a Big Sister!), Legislative Aide to Sonia Chang-Diaz, <strong>Angela Vo</strong>, and Executive Director of the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators, <strong>Lauren Scribi</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The women discussed their career paths and their passion for public service &ndash; highlighting interests in environmental justice, broader availability of fresh food, and access to public education. One Little Sister asked if it was hard to run for office. The legislators&rsquo; resounding response was &ldquo;yes, and it&rsquo;s worth it, because it&rsquo;s very gratifying&rdquo;. The group strongly encouraged Little Sisters to run for office in the future, and shared ways that they could even get involved in their communities and classrooms today &ndash; including by proposing legislation. The panelists gave the example of a second grade class that proposed Massachusetts adopt the ladybug as our state bug, and now it&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/massachusetts/state-insect/ladybug\" target=\"_blank\">official</a>!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBased on our panel, it might seem like the majority of State House legislators are women. However, the reality is that only <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/state_fact_sheets/ma\" target=\"_blank\">25% of our 200</a> Massachusetts legislators are women. As Marie Wilson of the White House Project notably remarked: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t be what you can&rsquo;t see,&rdquo; which is why it is critical for more women to hold political office now and show girls that they have unlimited options when it comes to career choices. Additional benefits of having more women in office include women being <a href=\"http://gap.hks.harvard.edu/seeing-believing-exposure-counterstereotypic-women-leaders-and-its-effect-malleability-automatic\" target=\"_blank\">less likely to hold traditional stereotypes</a> when they see other women in power and an increase in productivity among <a href=\"http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2015/04/diversity-leads-stronger-outcomes-says-lecturer\" target=\"_blank\">diverse groups</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Women-Legislators1.jpg?rs30\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, the number of women in the State House has stayed fairly <a href=\"http://www.cawp.rutgers.edu/state_fact_sheets/ma\" target=\"_blank\">stagnant since 1993</a>. The Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators works to change that by speaking to groups of girls, like our Little Sisters. <a href=\"https://www.american.edu/spa/wpi/upload/Girls-Just-Wanna-Not-Run_Policy-Report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Research</a> shows that when women run for office, they win at the same rate as men. Yet, women don&#39;t run as frequently &ndash; partially because young women are less exposed to political news and information than young men, and are less often encouraged to run for office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the support of our professional staff and activities that expose girls to new opportunities, Big Sisters are uniquely positioned to understand and help Little Sisters develop their strengths and ambitions. If you&#39;re interested in ways to encourage a girl&rsquo;s interest in politics, check out this <a href=\"http://tag.rutgers.edu/11-ways-to-encourage-your-daughter-to-pursue-politics/\" target=\"_blank\">blog post</a> from the Rutgers University&#39;s &quot;Teach A Girl to Lead&quot; project. It&#39;s written specifically for fathers, but is relevant for all adults who want to educate and inspire the girls in their lives. And, to find out more about your legislators, check out this <a href=\"https://malegislature.gov/People/Search\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As always, thank you to all our Big Sisters for your guidance, support, and willingness to learn and grow alongside your Little Sisters.. And, a huge thank you our hosts from the Massachusetts Caucus of Women Legislators for everything you do to elevate women and girls in the city of Boston.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p>&ldquo;I look at Natalia and I see my past self,&rdquo; said Big Sister Luz Villar. Luz, 24, and Natalia, 16, say they are often mistaken for biological sisters. They share similarities such as living in Dorchester, identifying as both Puerto Rican and Dominican, and a penchant for dressing alike, especially when attending Big Sister Boston-sponsored events like our annual Appreciation Breakfast. But, their connection goes far deeper than the matching outfits they relish combing the racks for at Goodwill.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLike her Little Sister, Luz grew up in a household led by a single mother. Luz was the eldest child and her family moved around the Boston area often, making it difficult for Luz to consistently attend any one school. In high school, Luz enrolled in a vocational school, knowing that she could remain there even if her family moved again. She excelled academically and went on to attend architectural college. When financial challenges forced her to leave college, she found a job at State Street Corporation. She then enrolled in Cambridge College where she will earn her bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Business Management this spring. Luz still felt there was something missing, and it was at an information session hosted by State Street that she first heard about Big Sister Boston and knew she wanted to get involved. &ldquo;I wanted to do something meaningful with my free time,&rdquo; said Luz.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Luz-Natalia2.jpg?rs30\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After interviewing Luz, our enrollment and matching team knew that she would be a great fit with Little Sister Natalia. In February of 2014, the two were matched. Natalia admitted she kept to herself at first, but Luz&rsquo;s efforts to get to know Natalia at her own pace paid off. Natalia soon became comfortable with her new Big Sister and began share more of her thoughts and feelings. A few months later, the two were chatting about what they would wear to their first Big Sister Appreciation Breakfast, and Little Sister Natalia stated firmly: &ldquo;We should &lsquo;twin it.&rsquo;&rdquo; It was then that a tradition was born and the Sisters soon became known for their matching outfits at our events. During the breakfast they met other Big and Little Sister matches who had been together for five and ten years and they both knew then that they wanted that kind of longevity, too.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLuz and Natalia&rsquo;s conversations range from the silly to the serious. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m bringing myself down, Luz will bring me back up,&rdquo; said Natalia. &ldquo;When I hang with my friends, we don&rsquo;t talk like I talk with Luz. My mom and I are close, but when I talk with Luz it&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m a like a grown woman with her.&rdquo; Over a plate of homemade french fries they have concocted together (their favorite food), Luz and Natalia might joke around, plan their next adventure, or talk about their big plans for the future. Before being matched with Luz, Natalia had no plans to go to college. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think I needed it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Luz opened my eyes to the world.&rdquo; After graduating from middle school?&mdash;?where Luz cheered loudly for her Little Sister?&mdash;?Natalia was accepted to Snowden International School, an academically rigorous school in the Boston Public School system. Now in her sophomore year, Natalia is determined to go to college and wants to become a counselor for teenagers. She draws the inspiration to achieve her goals from her Big Sister. Despite challenges along the way, Luz will graduate from college in a few months and Natalia will be there to cheer loudly when Luz receives her diploma. &ldquo;I see Luz, and that&rsquo;s my future,&rdquo; said Natalia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p>Each year, nearly 200 Big and Little Sisters gather to celebrate the holidays at Big Sister Boston&rsquo;s Winter Wonderland, one of our four annual events designed to support girls&rsquo; healthy development. Recurring events give matches a fun, free space to try new things and develop cherished traditions together &ndash; key ingredients for cultivating a strong mentoring relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matches arrived on a Sunday morning, December 6, to this year&rsquo;s Winter Wonderland at Faneuil Hall. They were greeted by a bountiful spread of food &ndash; donated by local grocery stores &ndash; and beautiful holiday decorations. This year&rsquo;s theme, It&rsquo;s Your Story, encouraged Sisters to embrace the uniqueness of their relationships and the commonalities they share. Among them were <strong>Big Sister Helen Queenan</strong> and <strong>Little Sister Laila </strong>(pictured left), who were matched in June. Since then, they&rsquo;ve attended nearly every one of our program events together: including a tour of New England Cable News with Nelly Carre&ntilde;o and a tour of City Hall with the Office of Women&rsquo;s Advancement and Mayor Walsh.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThey definitely couldn&rsquo;t miss Winter Wonderland. As Helen said, &ldquo;My Little Sister and I always look forward to the wonderfully engaging events that Big Sister Boston hosts, and the Winter Wonderland event was no exception. This event was extremely enjoyable, as it was festive, and brought together other Sister matches as we were all able to share in laughter and activities!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Winter-Wonderland2.jpg?rs27\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Winter Wonderland, Helen and Laila created a new story through multiple activities: coding with the MIT Media Lab (also enjoyed by matches like Big Sister Sarah Branz and Little Sister Sidney, pictured right), dancing and playing music games with Microsoft, drawing their self-portrait on a Sister mural, and taking their photo with The Snap Boxx photo-booth. Matches captured their own stories of the day in a take-home booklet where they recorded memories from their relationship, favorite activities, and what they&rsquo;ve learned from each other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To wrap up the event, Little Sisters helped <strong>Big Sister CEO Deb Re</strong> present six raffle prizes &ndash; including a creative card-making class at Paper Source, roller skating at Chez Vous in Dorchester, and tag at Laser Quest in West Roxbury, to a lucky group of winners!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe look forward to planning our spring annual event, the Appreciation Breakfast, with the support of our community of donors, partners, matches, and families.&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p>Building strong, lasting mentoring relationships is integral to achieving positive outcomes for girls. And, the key to fostering those relationships is to have the space to explore shared interests together. Thanks to our partnerships with local organizations, institutions, affinity groups, and businesses, Big Sister Boston is able to provide enrichment activities for our Big and Little Sister matches&mdash;at no cost&mdash;that nurture girls&rsquo; healthy development, while also creating safe spaces for the match to strengthen their bond through new shared experiences. Read on to find out how partners like Boston-based fitness clothing brand <strong>Crane &amp; Lion </strong>are helping get #Girls2Great!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Mat1.jpg?rs26\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were first introduced to Crane &amp; Lion in 2014 through co-founder and former <strong>Big Sister,&nbsp;Caitriona Taylor</strong>. This past July, Caitriona taught yoga classes throughout the day at our Annual Summer Picnic, held at Dana Hall in Wellesley and attended by more than 100 Big and Little Sisters matches. Activities at the picnic ranged from swimming to basketball, and dancing to art projects, and the undeniable Sister favorite of the day was Caitriona&rsquo;s yoga class! The class created a fun and safe environment that allowed Big and Little Sisters to engage in something unfamiliar, exercise their concentration, and incorporate their playful sides into reimagined yoga poses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the four years that Caitriona was matched with her Little Sister, <strong>Helen Fullerton, the Senior Match Support Specialist at Big Sister Boston</strong> who supported the Sister relationship, remembers Caitriona&rsquo;s consistency and patience with her Little Sister&mdash;qualities integral to a healthy mentoring relationship and a healthy yoga practice. The benefits of yoga for men and women of any age are clear, but they are particularly helpful in building resiliency in adolescent girls by promoting improved body awareness, self-esteem, and confidence. Yoga teaches those who practice to experiment, test their boundaries, and create their own routine. It&rsquo;s a non-judgmental practice that evolves differently with each individual and can create a lasting positive impact&mdash;not unlike mentoring!</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Mat2.jpg?rs27\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to continuing their partnership with Big Sister Boston and providing more opportunities for Big and Little Sisters, Caitriona and the Crane &amp; Lion team are excited to launch their brand ambassadors program. We are excited about the program as well, since the role of the brand ambassadors is directly in line with the work we do at Big Sister Boston: to inspire women (and girls!) to feel good about themselves every day by cultivating a healthy, resilient mind-set that includes fitness and self-care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10152970138245796.1073741886.33108570795&amp;type=3\" target=\"_blank\">Click here</a> to view more photos from Big Sister Boston&rsquo;s Summer Sister Picnic, and here to learn more about <a href=\"http://craneandlion.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crane &amp; Lion</a>.</strong></p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><strong>Be Present, Not Perfect&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\n<em>by guest blogger, Big Sister Kate Blanchard</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nMind over matter. The early bird gets the worm. These are all sayings that we hear each day and often have lost their meaning. But there&rsquo;s one saying I can get behind: <strong>be present, not perfect</strong>. As a recent newcomer to the blogging world, the temptation to strive for perfection over presence in my work is easy and can become all-consuming.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI try to be true to myself and channel this idea in my relationship with my Little Sister, Tatiana, as well. Being a Big Sister, I&rsquo;m learning so much about myself and what it means to put your true self forward every day.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHere&rsquo;s my story of how I became a Big Sister and how I&rsquo;ve learned that being present is more important than being perfect:<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOne of my personal goals of 2014 was to find a way to give back. In teaching (I&rsquo;m a fifth grade teacher by day), time is a valuable and often fleeting commodity. Outside of &nbsp;the classroom, my time is often spent lesson planning, grading and even dreaming some nights about school. I knew I needed to find an opportunity where the time I spent volunteering was meaningful.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nDuring the interview process to become a Big Sister, I never imagined how fortunate I&rsquo;d be to find a Little Sister like mine. As I gave each answer, I wondered if it was the right one or would it lead me to the right match&mdash;again striving for perfection instead of being present and trusting the process. A few months passed without a match, but that moment I met Tatiana I knew that trusting the process was the right thing to do.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn the beginning I was worried whether I would pick the right activities or whether we&rsquo;d have something in common to talk about. Then I realized that just giving her my time is enough. She&rsquo;s not worried about whether our visits don&rsquo;t turn out exactly as planned; she just wants to have a shared experience.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nTatiana has taught me that it&rsquo;s ok to let loose, do things just for fun and not worry about what others think. She writes poetry and then finds competitions to enter, talks about one of our visits to the Science Museum as the &lsquo;best day ever&rsquo; and has dreams of being a pediatrician. In fourth grade, she&rsquo;s certainly a forward-thinking young lady.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHere are some of the adventures we&rsquo;ve been on&mdash;more to come! Did they all turn out perfectly? Certainly not! Did you know you can&rsquo;t go rock climbing if you forget socks&hellip; but ice cream and getting our nails done was just as fun!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More&nbsp;about my adventures with Tatiana on my blog, Simply Adored. <a href=\"http://simplyadored.com/category/philanthropy/\" target=\"_blank\">http://simplyadored.com/category/philanthropy/</a></p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><strong>The Big Sister Alumnae Association has asked current and former Big Sisters to share their stories through The BIG Picture blog series. For many, the motivation to become a Big Sister is the opportunity to mentor a girl and give her the support she needs to reach her full potential. &nbsp;This blog series focuses on highlighting stories in which Little Sisters help us grow to become more grounded, confident, and caring women.&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Hands.png\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m not sure what I expected when I was first matched. &nbsp;Well, I guess I do. I thought I would swoop in and help my Little Sister in all aspects of her life; act as her confidant and friend; and make a profound and long-lasting impression on her life. Though I thought being a Big Sister meant changing my Little Sister&rsquo;s life in &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; ways, I quickly realized that it isn&rsquo;t about obvious, &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; changes; it&rsquo;s about much more (or less noticeable) changes than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I eagerly awaited our first meeting at school. &nbsp;Alexis and I both wore big smiles. Willa, our Match Support Specialist, brilliantly started us off with an ice breaker game and we were &quot;good to go&quot;. Then, week after week, we met over her school lunch break. We would fly down the stairs and take our place in the front of the lunch line and hurry back up to eat and enjoy our time together. I was charmed by Alexis immediately. She is artistic, clever, funny, and incredibly kind. She has a singing voice that deserves to be heard. And boy, does she love to do crafts. I feared that stamping cards and making rainbow loom bracelets would eventually get boring. I felt I should expose her to something more inspirational. We decided to make holiday cards for recovering soldiers and we learned about inspirational women from history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we did these activities together, I started to reflect on the significance of our relationship. I realized the significance doesn&rsquo;t exist in the actual bracelet we made or the Mad Libs we wrote, or even helping her with homework. &nbsp;Instead, it exists in the &ldquo;<em>little</em>,&rdquo; intangible things. It&#39;s the week after week commitment of spending time with each other. It&rsquo;s knowing that both of us are looking forward to our time together, and the fact that we have set everything else aside for these few minutes. It&rsquo;s about being present. It&#39;s not about the &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; changes that Big Sisters expect we will have on our Little Sister; &quot;she&#39;s less likely to drop out, or miss school, or become a teen mom.&quot; It&#39;s the &ldquo;<em>little</em>&rdquo; things like a shared secret about her new crush; it is the things she chooses to share with me and the things I share with her and the trust we instill in one another. All of these &ldquo;<em>little</em>&rdquo; aspects of our time spent together amount to the &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; impact our relationship has on our lives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My relationship with Alexis, a relationship of mutual support and trust, has helped me so much in my own life, especially with my family and career. In my life and with her, I want to do &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; things, great things. It all starts with the commitment, being present and turning off the cell phone. I&#39;ve remembered to focus more on the everyday conversations with my kids, friends, and husband. I&#39;ve remembered it&#39;s not the &ldquo;<em>big</em>&rdquo; finale, but the &ldquo;<em>little</em>&rdquo; path that leads you there.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blogpost by Little Sister Leilani and Big Sister Talia Doucette</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Comfort-Zone.jpg\" style=\"height:216px; width:288px\" /></strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&ldquo;Move out of your comfort zone. You can only grow if you are willing to feel awkward and uncomfortable when you try something new.&rdquo; &ndash; Brian Tracy</em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nRecently, the Big Sister organization asked us if we would like to write a blog post for their website. &nbsp;The first thought that both of us had was, &ldquo;how do we write a blog post?&rdquo; &nbsp;We had never written anything like this before, and we knew it might take time to figure out how to even get started, let alone what we would actually write about. Yet, we do a lot of match activities that make us uncomfortable or nervous, and they are often things we have never done. &nbsp;However, every time we have taken a chance on something new, we create great memories &ndash; even if we weren&rsquo;t completely successful at what we set out to do.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSuddenly, we had a great idea &ndash; let&rsquo;s talk about situations that have actually made us uncomfortable in our blog post, and what we have learned in the process!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Rock-Climbing.jpg\" style=\"height:300px; line-height:20.8px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rock Climbing</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBig Sister Talia: A few months ago, we took indoor rock climbing certificate classes. This entailed holding a rope while the other climbed and catching one another if we fell. &nbsp;Physically, this was a new challenge for both of us, but it became more of a mental test for me. &nbsp;Leila and I were paired up with someone we did not know in the lesson. This was far out of my comfort zone, because I had to trust someone, whom I didn&rsquo;t know, to keep me safe while I was climbing. &nbsp;I also wanted to make sure that Leila felt safe because that is part of my job as a Big Sister. &nbsp;In the end, we used the communication techniques our Instructor taught us, and had a great time with the other guests. Together, we learned new skills, challenged one another, and accomplished our goals. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Rock-Climbing-1.jpg\" style=\"height:400px; line-height:20.8px; width:300px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Body Image</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLittle Sister Leila: I&rsquo;ve never been a fan of flip-flops or sandals because I&rsquo;m insecure about my toes, and I had never even let Talia see my toes. After over a year of Talia suggesting we go get pedicures, I caved and let her paint my toenails about a month ago. &nbsp;I must admit, the pedicure looked nice when Talia was done! &nbsp;Although I don&rsquo;t wear sandals everyday, I do wear them more than I used to. Now, I actually wear them to the beach instead of wearing sneakers. I&rsquo;m a little more confident about my toes.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><br />\r\nSpontaneity</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Big Sister Talia: Before Leila and I do activities, I like to make sure I have all the facts and I am well-prepared - because I want to make sure that we have fun and are comfortable. &nbsp;Last year, we were walking back to the train in Dorchester after a match activity, when Leila saw a tiny corner restaurant that sold some of her favorite Hispanic foods. We were both hungry so I let her take the lead and followed her into the store. Everyone was speaking Spanish, and my German language training was not helpful in this situation. I had to rely on Leila to order us some Pastelillos &ndash; deep fried pastries with delicious fillings. This was a completely unplanned visit, but it was so great to see Leila take the lead and teach me about her culture. This experience also taught me how to be more spontaneous. It is still one of my favorite memories!</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>Communication</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nLittle Sister Leila: Although I was comfortable ordering Pastelillos, I am usually very timid and nervous whenever I have to interact with strangers. I don&rsquo;t like to speak to anyone I don&rsquo;t know. Talia frequently asks me if I want to order food for us. These are small things, but they go a long way. Recently, I traveled from North Carolina to Boston by myself, and I felt comfortable talking with the flight attendant on my own. &nbsp;I think that ordering food myself more often boosted my confidence when interacting with people I don&rsquo;t know.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we wrote about these uncomfortable situations, we have agreed that these have been some of our favorite memories and adventures together. &nbsp;Stepping out of our comfort zones has made us stronger and closer as Sisters, and helped us have so much fun along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blogpost by Caroline Gulde, Big Sister</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I conceptualized The BIG Picture blog series, I wanted to share insight into the complex and often challenging responsibility of &ldquo;walking the talk&rdquo; as a Big Sister: a woman advocating for girls&rsquo; leadership, individuality, and positive self-esteem. I&rsquo;ve battled my own demons enough to know that actually embodying and living these messages is where the real work lies.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSeveral months ago, my fianc&eacute; said, &ldquo;I have a challenge for you&rdquo;. &ldquo;What if you tried talking to yourself the way you&rsquo;d want to talk to the young girls of today?&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; I asked, blithely. Although, of course, I knew exactly what he meant. As I sat there in front of the mirror, I felt a pang of guilt. I rewound our conversation to the place where I muttered something cruel about my appearance. As I thought about it more, I realized that this was not a single incident of negative self-talk, it had become the way I talked to myself. The constant self-scrutiny, the endless negative self-criticism&hellip;these habits had become so familiar they were practically out of my realm of awareness. Of course, I would never treat anyone the way that I&rsquo;ve come to treat myself&mdash;certainly not the young girls I hope to help&hellip; and especially not my Little Sister.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nBack in December, a day with my Little Sister helped me see past my own self-scrutiny. My Little Sister and I planned an outing to the Boston Common Frog Pond. She had never been ice-skating before, and I hadn&rsquo;t skated in well over a decade. As I watched the sea of people gliding around in a swirl of clumsy chaos, I tried not to show my apprehension. We laced up our skates and waited as the Zamboni restored the rink to a glistening finish under the twinkly holiday lights. My Little Sister&rsquo;s excitement and optimism were equally illuminating.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOut on the ice, she was fearless. There were wobbles, shrieks of laughter, and wipeouts&mdash;none of which stopped her from making her way around and around&hellip;even if it meant clutching the barrier or my mitten-covered hands for dear life. There was no sign of discouragement in her thrilled expression. I realized I was witnessing something more beautiful than a smile, particular hairstyle, or flawless complexion. Her confidence, determination, and courage were her best features.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI knew then that if I wanted to show my Little Sister the valuable qualities she so effortlessly displays, I&rsquo;d have to dig deep under the layers of fear and self-doubt to reclaim those same qualities in myself. If there is anything I want to model for my Little Sister, it&rsquo;s how to have a healthy relationship with herself, how to achieve a level of acceptance and inner peace that transcends physical appearance, socio-economic status, and cultural expectations. What if our only mirrors were one another? What features would you want your Little Sister to see?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI have accepted the challenge, and perhaps some of you will join me and share your stories of how being a Big Sister has impacted the way you see yourself and your unique place in the world. I&rsquo;m confident that, together, we will learn to walk the talk&hellip; one compassionate step at a time.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blogpost by Ann Marie Marzilli, Coordinator of School-Based Mentoring</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Big Sister, we know the importance of matching girls with mentors that will help them gain confidence, life skills and make healthy choices. We often think of &lsquo;healthy choices&rsquo; to mean taking care of one&rsquo;s body by avoiding risky behaviors, but healthy choices include the food you eat and getting outside to be active! The summer is a great time to take advantage of both activities and you can start by looking to see when and where the closest Farmer&rsquo;s Market is at: <a href=\"https://www.massfarmersmarkets.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.massfarmersmarkets.org</a>. Farmer&rsquo;s Markets are conveniently located in Boston&rsquo;s neighborhoods and nearby urban towns making them easy and accessible to visit. This is a great way to help guide your Little Sister and put her on a path for a healthy future by making a day out of visiting your local Farmer&rsquo;s Market!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Michelle Obama is on the forefront of changing the way that children and adolescents think about eating and staying active with her &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s Move!&rdquo; campaign. The First Lady&rsquo;s campaign, &ldquo;combining comprehensive strategies with common sense, Let&rsquo;s Move! is about putting children on the path to a healthy future during their earliest months and years (<a href=\"http://www.letsmove.gov/about\" target=\"_blank\">www.letsmove.gov/about</a>)&rdquo;. This is a great website to find new ideas on ways you and your Little Sister can stay active and healthy this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you and your Little Sister are up for another adventure, check out <a href=\"http://kidshealth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">www.kidshealth.org</a> for fun and easy recipes you can try using the goodies you purchased!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting outside to enjoy the sunshine and warm weather is an added bonus to supporting your Little Sister&rsquo;s healthy future!</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blogpost by Rebecca Eidelman, Recruitment Specialist</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/legos.jpg?rs46\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:5px; margin-right:5px\" />I recently attended my cousin&rsquo;s baby shower, where I found myself walled in by a room of pink: pink onesies, pink outfits, pink blankets&mdash;even the wrapping paper was pink. It&rsquo;s not surprising that pink was the color of the day: take a look inside any toy store, and you&rsquo;ll see aisles of pink merchandise. Toy manufacturers color code their toys for either boys or girls, but rarely for both.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe MFA has a <a href=\"http://www.mfa.org/exhibitions/think-pink\" target=\"_blank\">new exhibit</a> called &ldquo;Think Pink&rdquo; which tracks the history of pink in fashion. Pink, as I learned, has not always been the harbinger of all things girly. In 1914, <a href=\"http://forgottenhistoryblog.com/pink-wasnt-always-considered-a-feminine-color-and-blue-wasnt-always-masculine/\" target=\"_blank\">The Sunday Sentinel advised parents,</a> &ldquo;If you like the color note on the little one&rsquo;s garments, use pink for the boy and blue for the girl, if you are a follower of convention.&rdquo; One hundred years later, that cultural norm has made a complete turnaround. Not only is pink the best way to tell the rest of the world that your child is female, but it signals to girls, this toy was made for you.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs a child, I gravitated towards all things pink and purple. I also loved LEGOs, and didn&rsquo;t seem to care if they were made for boys or girls (or if I was stealing them from my brothers). Today, if I wanted to buy a LEGO set for a girl, I would be referred to the LEGO Friends line&mdash;a feminized version of regular LEGO sets that do not include instructions and use pink and purple packaging. If this seems strange to you, you&rsquo;re not alone. <a href=\"http://time.com/3281/goldie-blox-pink-aisle-debate/\" target=\"_blank\">According to TIME Magazine</a>, &ldquo;Global Toy Experts conducted a survey of 1,700 American moms three years ago asking them to compare the toys they played with growing up to those that their daughters were playing with today. They found a 25 percent drop across the board in girls playing with toys that would be considered gender-neutral or male (like construction or science kit toys).&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Where are the toys that promote interest in STEM activities? Where are the chemistry sets that make goo and controlled explosions? You can find those activities in the boys&rsquo; aisle.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At Big Sister, we want girls to reach their full potential in whatever future they choose, including professions where men currently outnumber women. Recently, our Little Sisters attended a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigSisterBoston/photos/a.405843830795.187531.33108570795/10151967488995796/?type=1&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">series of hands-on science and engineering themed activities at the Microsoft NERD center</a>, hosted by the Society of Women Engineers. In March, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigSisterBoston/photos/pcb.10151914674210796/10151914673045796/?type=1&amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\">volunteers from the Boston Police Department interacted</a> with girl waiting to be matched with Big Sisters. This summer, we will have a workshop with Biogen. I believe in the power of positive role modeling, and I am proud of the efforts our staff makes to ensure that girls see women in professions typically dominated by men. So what is the problem with all of this pink?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When girls only identify with products marketed towards them, they miss out on a world of products designed for boys, many of which promote innovation, problem solving, and construction. In Ellen Seiter&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Sold Separately&rdquo; she <a href=\"https://thesocietypages.org/girlwpen/2014/01/01/stop-the-war-on-pink-lets-take-a-look-at-toys-for-boys/\" target=\"_blank\">mentions</a>, &ldquo;Advertisements for girls&rsquo; toys have undergone fewer changes than other toys in the past fifty years because they continue to depict girls&rsquo; play as a miniature version of their mothers&rsquo; domestic work.&rdquo; In other words, girls&rsquo; toys are limited to the functions they&rsquo;ve performed for the last half century. <a href=\"http://www.parents.com/health/parents-news-now/\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Gottlieb, CEO of toy industry consulting firm Global Toy Experts,</a> says, &ldquo;Wanting to be a doctor or architect or cook, that really begins when you&rsquo;re young and walking around with a stethoscope or playing with an Easy Bake oven.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Pink.jpg?rs70\" /><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:11px\">One mother, artist JeongMee Yoon, was so astounded by her daughter&rsquo;s &ldquo;affinity&rdquo; for pink, she photographed her daughter with all of her pink possessions.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we want girls to envision a future without typical gender roles, we have to let them explore as astronomers, geologists, and architects without limiting them to domestic play.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nParents and other caregivers have decided to campaign against the increasing pool of gender-specific toys. One organization, PinkStinks, was started by women tired of seeing their favorite toys show up in pink hues for the holiday season. According to their website, &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.pinkstinks.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">PinkStinks</a> is a campaign that targets the products, media and marketing that prescribe heavily stereotyped and limiting roles to young girls. We believe that all children &ndash; girls and boys &ndash; are affected by the &lsquo;pinkification&rsquo; of girlhood. Our aim is to challenge and reverse this growing trend.&rdquo; A quick look at their website, and you&rsquo;re inundated with images of &ldquo;pinkified&rdquo; products: a pink monopoly set, pink-slippered horses, even a pink globe (yes, the ocean is pink too). Another organization, <a href=\"http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Let Toys Be Toys</a>, opposes toys and books with labels stating if they are for boys or girls. Perhaps, with more people working to make the world a less pink place for our children, girls will be interested in a broader range of toys&mdash;and careers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Someday, when my cousin&rsquo;s daughter is toddling around with her pink toys and pink shoes, I&rsquo;m sure she&rsquo;ll love the color pink as much as I once did. But that won&rsquo;t stop me from introducing her to the wonders of <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Mini-Volcano\" target=\"_blank\">mini-volcanoes</a>, collecting rocks, or <a href=\"http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-Playdough-Play-doh/\" target=\"_blank\">making Play-Doh</a>. We might even make it green.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;d like to find toys geared towards girls that emphasize engineering and STEM skills, check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVCC83cDch0&amp;list=TLOZgZh431LSCyY2vnRb6YoPn-znJcDU3u\" target=\"_blank\">GoldieBlox</a>.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post by: Jennifer Phaiah, Enrollment &amp; Match Support Specialist</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best parts of being on staff at Big Sister is hearing all of the wonderful, heart-warming, successes of a great visit between sisters. Nothing is better than when my e-mail inbox is flooded with tales of games played, jokes told, and trust built. It is a joy to hear about all the fun they are having, and the moments when a Big Sister can really feel the effects of all her hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>However, like any relationship there can be challenges and bumps along the road. </strong>Sometimes, for example, I will hear about a Little Sister who cheated at Candy Land, or said your joke was &ldquo;silly&rdquo;, or hated your shoes - and told you so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On some level, we know that Little Sisters are constantly learning and growing, often navigating these same situations with peers. But the fact remains, whether we&rsquo;re six or twenty-six, unkind words can hurt. Many Big Sisters have asked, &ldquo;What do I do&rdquo; when this happens?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is first important to acknowledge, that this will most likely happen and is normal.<strong> Your Little Sister is figuring out how to establish herself in your relationship, and in the context of her ever-growing world. </strong>&nbsp;Likely, this will manifest as a healthy and normal testing of limits and boundaries. &nbsp;Though working through this can be nerve-wracking, it is a process that ultimately helps your Little Sister to trust you, and your relationship. On a larger scale, beyond the scope of your relationship, your Little Sister is experimenting with social etiquettes - skills she will utilize for the rest of her life. This often means she is developing a sense of empathy, and a healthy thought-filter. Depending on her age, she may recognize her words as hurtful; or, she may be oblivious. So where does that leave you?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, it is tempting to be your Little Sister&rsquo;s superhero. You shower her with praise and encouragement, never wanting to be anything but the happiest, most energized version of yourself. <strong>But being a great mentor also means demonstrating how to respectfully and openly communicate when you&rsquo;re upset by someone&rsquo;s actions or words. &nbsp;</strong>When you hide your thoughts, feelings, and boundaries, it can give the false impression, that you are unshakeable, unbreakable, and at the end of the day, pretty un-relatable. This can also send the message that it is okay to stay quiet when your feelings are hurt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most common ways that youth learn social development is through the modeling of others. <strong>Whether you realize it or not, your Little Sister is constantly taking cues from you, on what it means to be an awesome woman.</strong> Sharing your feelings gives your Little Sister the permission to share hers too! While these conversations aren&rsquo;t always easy, they help to teach important communication skills. They can also greatly enhance trust in your relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still feeling a little shaky? Call your Match Support Specialist and ask for help! Taking off the cape and sharing your feelings can be nerve-wracking. <strong>Just remember, that kind of bravery is why your Little Sister would choose you over Wonder Woman any day of the week!</strong></p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post By: Big Sister Caitlin Littlefield</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I sat in the leather chair, ready to take on any questions thrown my way. Naturally, some were harder than others, but there was one question that made me think twice:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Who is your mentor?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, I said my parents. Then, I said my supervisor from my internship in college, and a colleague who has been helping me with my writing. (Writing is a skill I desperately want to improve.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then an unexpected thought popped into my mind: &ldquo;I have one more person who is a mentor in my life,&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;But this one is a little different.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>My fourth mentor is 13 years younger than me. She&rsquo;s my Little Sister.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I didn&rsquo;t plan on talking about my Little Sister at the job interview that day. In fact, my mind was so cluttered with information about my skills and my professional background that I figured it didn&rsquo;t have room for my time with D&rsquo;Ana.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D&rsquo;Ana is 12. She&rsquo;s smart. She&rsquo;s funny. And, she probably has no idea of the influence she&rsquo;s had on my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I sat there talking about her, I was surprised about the level of her influence, too. Along with being younger, she has less education and has half of my life experience. So how could she be a mentor to me? It turns out she does just as much for me (and maybe more) than my other mentors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAnd here&rsquo;s how:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s taught me to appreciate the small things.</strong> The first time I took D&rsquo;Ana into the city for dinner, I was constantly looking at my watch. It was a school night, and I wanted to make sure she was home in time to finish her homework. The hustle and bustle of the city, along with the cold of winter, means that people usually rush to their next destination. That wasn&rsquo;t the case with D&rsquo;Ana. D&rsquo;Ana pointed out the holiday decorations. She pointed out the skyscrapers, asking which one was the tallest. When we came across students playing music on the sidewalk, she asked if we could stay and watch. That&rsquo;s when I realized that, for D&rsquo;Ana, it was the small things that added up. She didn&rsquo;t care where we ate dinner that night; she wanted to enjoy every moment on the journey.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s taught me to be a better listener.</strong> Listening is such an important communication skill, and one we don&rsquo;t practice nearly enough. When I first became a Big Sister, I was concerned that if I wasn&rsquo;t asking D&rsquo;Ana questions or there was silence between us, she would think our outings were boring. But I learned you don&rsquo;t always need to be asking 20 questions. Instead, you should focus more on the art of listening. I truly love listening to D&rsquo;Ana, and hearing about what she learned at school. I&rsquo;ve transferred that mindset to my professional work and find I&rsquo;m much better at hearing what my colleagues are saying.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>She&rsquo;s taught me to insert humor into my daily routine.</strong> &nbsp;D&rsquo;Ana finds humor in the simplest things. She is constantly smiling and laughing. Sometimes, I&rsquo;ll even ask what she&rsquo;s laughing at, curious and thinking that I may have missed something. Being around D&rsquo;Ana&rsquo;s constant smile and laughter has made me think about how much I smile and laugh throughout my day. Working a challenging, full-time job can be stressful, but I&rsquo;ve realized that humor and fun are two must-haves in a workplace. By taking a bigger role in my organization&rsquo;s wellness team, going to the gym with colleagues on lunch breaks, and scheduling lunch outings every few weeks, I&rsquo;ve made sure that I have a little fun in between my work.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So, D&rsquo;Ana may not have been my first thought when I heard the word &ldquo;mentor.&rdquo; But she&rsquo;s already made a lasting impression on my life &ndash; and taught me more than I ever expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Caitlin has been matched with D&#39;Ana since November 2013.</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If you are interested in being a guest blogger on our website please contact Chelsea Roberts at <a href=\"mailto:croberts@bigsister.org\">croberts@bigsister.org</a>.</strong></p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post By: Helen Fullerton, Match Support Specialist</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often times there are many areas in a girl&#39;s life where she has a need for support or extra help. Perhaps she has emotional challenges due to early trauma or life issues such as, poverty or lack of opportunities. Big Sisters can sometimes feel overwhelmed by a myriad of situations that may be standing in the way of her Little Sister&#39;s development and are left wondering how they can have a positive influence on addressing these challenges. In these circumstances, we want Big Sisters to realize they are already doing something to help their Little Sister overcome obstacles she is facing by simply being present and there for her! As a mentor, you are providing individualized one to one attention for your Little Sister, an outlet for fun, exposing her to new opportunities and unconditional friendship. This may seem like a simple act, but it has a BIG impact on your Little Sister and her ability to overcome some of the challenges she may be experiencing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another tool a girl can use to face challenges and prevent them from having a negative impact is her self-esteem. What is self-esteem? Webster&#39;s dictionary defines it as, &quot;a feeling of having respect for yourself and your abilities.&quot; How is good self-esteem formed? There are variety of ways and one major way is through task mastery and a sense of competency. By helping your Little Sister learn a new skill or task and then letting her know she did it well will give her a sense of accomplishment and the vision of &quot;I can do it!&quot; Simple activities such as:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>making origami</li>\r\n\t<li>building something together</li>\r\n\t<li>learning how to ride a bike</li>\r\n\t<li>completing a puzzle</li>\r\n\t<li>baking a delicious dinner</li>\r\n\t<li>learning a new sport together</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Can2.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we all know it takes practice to learn something new. It can be frustrating to a child not to be able to accomplish something right away, however, it is OK to revisit what you and she were doing and, with gentle encouragement, try it again later. The reward of a mastering a new skill is immeasurable and lasting and can be a building block to a sense of future goals.</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post by: Emily Cutts, Match Support Specialist</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While our identities are influenced by many factors, media plays a huge role in how we see ourselves, especially for young girls. Traditionally, media&rsquo;s representation of women creates low expectations for female characters&mdash;the Disney princess whose life goal is marriage, the leading lady of action films in need of rescue, and even the cartoon damsel in distress (like Daphne in Scooby Doo). But the discourse is starting to change, making this an incredibly exciting time for readers and movie-goers. <strong>Mentors can inspire girls to learn about themselves and to question old ideas through reading books and watching films.</strong> Catching Fire is an exciting example of a book and a film with a positive female role model exploring her identity in an accessible way.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhen <em>The Hunger Games</em> book series was published, readers rejoiced. This was dystopian literature for young adults that could teach them to question common assumptions about identity, morality, agency, individualism, and free will; and the main character is a strong-willed, blunt, selfless, and brave girl. When the film adaptations came out, there was a different kind of excitement: though books are a wonderful tool for self-exploration, a film can make a story more accessible, especially for younger audiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do girls see when Katniss Everdeen takes the screen? A girl from a community with no resources, no access, and low odds, Katniss reminds us that in order to make positive change, we need to make choices; we can&rsquo;t wait passively for good things to happen to us. <strong>Although at times Katniss seems to be controlled by strong male figures, as well as her own fears and vulnerabilities, she is ultimately able to make her own choices and lead her own life. </strong>While she is not perfect, she may be a perfect character. The Hunger Games series offers us a heroine who is driven to protect and save the people she cares about. Girls can embrace Katniss because she is full of contradictions&mdash;courageous and terrified, vulnerable and resilient. She is a viable and valuable role model. (And let&rsquo;s not forget that she is also a great big sister!). Most importantly, she is a thoroughly human role model; she makes being a heroine seem possible.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nLet&rsquo;s talk with our girls about all those charming Disney princesses and princes. But let&rsquo;s also be deliberate about sharing stories about heroines like Katniss Everdeen, Harriet the Spy, Mulan, Merida, and Hermione Granger: complicated, intelligent, brave girls who can inspire and motivate our girls. &nbsp;We can use movies and stories to gently push them to discover their strengths.<strong> We can help them learn to be realistic about life&rsquo;s challenges and to be confident that they can meet those challenges. We can show them that they won&rsquo;t have to do it alone. </strong>This is our work: to help our girls by providing support, encouragement, and a positive influence as they learn what it means to be girls and to become women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Below are some wonderful resources with lists of age-appropriate books and films, conversation starters, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.amightygirl.com/\" target=\"_blank\">A Mighty Girl</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.sfgate.com/sfmoms/2012/06/29/girl-power-childrens-movies-with-strong-female-role-models/#6092101=1\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Power Children&#39;s Movies</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://movies.allwomenstalk.com/top-movie-heroines-who-make-good-role-models/3/\" target=\"_blank\">Heroines Who Make Good Role Models</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://therepresentationproject.org/\" target=\"_top\">The Representation Project</a></strong></p>\r\n",

Not only is there a lot of great music coming out; there are a ton of extraordinary young musicians that are great role models for girls. As a mentor, you can connect the young girls in your life with high-profile role models that can empower her to be her best self. (And it probably wouldn&#39;t hurt to get her listening to some good music, right?) Here&#39;s a list of some of our current favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Pop1.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" />Janelle Monae</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This Kansas City-based entertainer is rising to super-stardom at a dizzying pace. &nbsp;In addition to being a versatile musician, equally at home with R&amp;B, hard rock, hip-hop, and classical genres, she is a powerful advocate for personal style and female empowerment. &nbsp;You can enjoy her albums just for the music, but they also tell a fantastic story that is a metaphor for oppression. That is especially evident in one of our favorite lyrics here from her song Q.U.E.E.N.:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>We have felt the entire spectrum of emotion listening to Monae, but mostly, her music just makes us want to dance.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>&nbsp;</span><em>Are we a lost generation of our people?<br />\r\nAdd us to equations but they&#39;ll never make us equal<br />\r\nShe who writes the movie owns the script and the sequel<br />\r\nSo why ain&#39;t the stealing of my rights made illegal?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEddixS-UoU\" target=\"_blank\">Listen to Q.U.E.E.N., featuring Erykah Badu (another great woman role model!).</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Pop2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" />Laura Mvula</strong><br />\r\nWhere do we even begin? &nbsp;Laura Mvula&rsquo;s powerful and musically interesting songs have moved us in the most profound way possible. &nbsp;Her voice is timeless and unique, defying an easy label for her musical genre. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG8dCuMibdI\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Here&rsquo;s her song &quot;She&quot;</strong></a>, performed with a South African choir. &nbsp;It gives us goosebumps every time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Pop3.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" />Demi Lovato</strong><br />\r\nYou&rsquo;ve probably heard of Demi Lovato already, but did you know that she is an outspoken advocate for body image and mental health? &nbsp; Lovato is very public about her struggles with bipolar disorder and eating disorders, and has been praised for bringing these important issues into the mainstream discourse. &nbsp;Currently, Lovato is showing her support for LGBTQ rights by playing Santana&rsquo;s love interest on Glee. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AByfaYcOm4A\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>And yes, we still love rocking out to Heart Attack</strong></a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Pop4.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" />Hayley Williams &ndash; Paramore</strong><br />\r\nHayley Williams is an outspoken supporter of suicide prevention, anti-bullying, and ending child sex-trafficking and slavery. &nbsp;She is also a great advocate for personal strength and has never tried to market herself as a sex symbol, as she does not believe it is true to who she is. &nbsp;And Williams has an astonishingly powerful voice to boot. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OblL026SvD4\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>This clip is &quot;Still Into You.&quot;</strong></a> &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><a id=\"Back to Top\" name=\"Back to Top\"></a>Creating styles that mesmerize the masses is a difficult task. Managing an innovative and successful business as a female entrepreneur in Boston is even more difficult. &nbsp;In honor of our annual Fashion Show to benefit Big Sister Association on Tuesday, February 25th, we interviewed three women who have made their mark on Boston as strategic business owners and trailblazers in fashion: <a href=\"http://esmeraldalambert.com/about-us\" target=\"_blank\">Esmeralda Lambert</a>, a Boston based jewelry designer and Big Sister; Izzy Lopes, designer and owner of <a href=\"http://thethickychicky.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Thicky Chicky </a>and Big Sister; and the featured stylist of fashion show fame herself, <a href=\"http://www.denisehajjar.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Denise Hajjar</a>. Along with their brilliant success in fashion and business, inspiring and helping others in the process makes their careers fulfilling. While Lambert empowers women in the Dominican Republic by employing women in her native country, Lopes challenges the conventional perceptions of beauty by providing appealing fashion choices for plus size women. Together, they offered some insight into their journey of fashion, business, and, most importantly, charity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>At the most basic level, fashion is an expressive art form and, often, a reflection of one&rsquo;s personality, so what better way to get to know these three fashionistas than by exploring their own personal style.</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Denise Hajjar:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nMy fashion style has always been modern classic with a twist. &nbsp;I am a little retro, a throwback to the 50&#39;s and 60&#39;s, but current for today. &nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Esmeralda Lambert:</strong><br />\r\nI&rsquo;m a hybrid between classic and chic. On a typical Boston winter day, &nbsp;you can catch me in tall boots, leggings with a short cute dress, an accent scarf and, of course, a color coordinated set of Esmeralda Lambert statement jewelry for a finishing touch.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nMy style is eclectic and wide-ranging. &nbsp;I am not someone to be swayed by trends. Life is too short. I wear what I like and I encourage those around me to do the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>When and how did you know that fashion would be a passion of yours for the rest of your life?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Denise Hajjar:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nMy grandmother was a designer in Damascus Syria. &nbsp;She and her sisters would design and make clothing for the French women. &nbsp;It was in my blood. &nbsp;She would give me fabric and teach me how to cut and sew using my barbie dolls.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Esmeralda Lambert:</strong><br />\r\nAs child on a TV show in the Dominican Republic, surrounded by professional stylists, designers and makeup artists, I gained an appreciation for fashion, especially jewelry. I was looking to start my own venture and the perfect fit was to start my own statement jewelry company where all the pieces are hand-woven by women artisans in the Dominican. This brings all my passions together: fashion, business and creating jobs and empowering women in my home country.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nWhen I was younger, I used to cut the legs off my pants and the sleeves off my shirts. &nbsp;I was frequently armed with a pair of scissors and acrylic paint. &nbsp;No item of clothing was safe back then! I remember cutting one of my father&#39;s old t-shirts and fashioning a smaller t-shirt out of it using needle and thread. &nbsp;The finished product was a lopsided, tightly threaded mess, but I was super proud of my creation!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#Back to Top\">Back to Top</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>How difficult was it to make a career out of your passion?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Esmeralda Lambert:</strong><br />\r\nThere was a long road of preparation before I launched my passion into a business. I did my undergraduate studies in business administration, managed my family company for five years and completed an MBA from Babson College. These experiences gave me the tools and confidence to make the dream of my jewelry business into reality.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nIt is something that is still difficult. &nbsp; I am a full time mom and I have a full time job in the healthcare field. &nbsp;Between juggling parent-teacher conferences and developing Excel spreadsheets I have to make the time to do what I love. &nbsp;Luckily, I have a very strong support system who keep me motivated and focused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>In the beginning of your career, what obstacles did you face as a female artist and entrepreneur?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Denise Hajjar:</strong><br />\r\nFor the longest time, Boston was never considered a fashion city and we would be ignored by most. I just stayed focused and worked hard to be better and prove that there was good talent here in Boston. The few of us who stayed here and persevered, paved the way for all the others to start in Boston. Now, it is a great city full of young designers. Boston is a major force to be reckoned with.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nThe Naysayers! &nbsp;As much as I had people encouraging me to follow my dream and pushing me forward, there were a few people that caused me to doubt myself. &nbsp;It is very frustrating to be so committed and dedicated to your craft to then have people say, &quot;Plus size fashion? But why?&rdquo; Words like this just motivate me further and propel me towards greatness providing me with fuel for my ever growing &quot;fire&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"#Back to Top\" style=\"line-height: 20.8px;\">Back to Top</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>On a day-to-day basis, what keeps you motivated to do what you love: a person, philosophy, mantra, etc.?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Esmeralda Lambert:</strong><br />\r\nWhat gets me up in the morning and keeps me motivated is knowing that with every sale and new boutique that carries our jewelry I am able to empower more women artisans to support their livelihoods and make a larger ripple effect on their families and local communities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nDuring my launch event for the thicky chicky, I had countless women thank me for designing clothes for them. &nbsp;As a plus size woman myself, I know how frustrating it can be not to see yourself reflected appropriately in the media. &nbsp; I want my pieces, and the beautiful bodies filling them, to be worthy of a double-take.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2><strong>What words of wisdom would you give to aspiring fashionistas looking to make a career out of their passion?</strong></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Denise Hajjar:&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nLove what you do to a fault. Be authentic and humble. You must learn your craft inside and out, not just pretend to know it. Be ready to work hard, really hard, for a long time with a smile on your face while doing it!<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/QA1.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" /></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Esmeralda Lambert:</strong><br />\r\nJust having passion alone is not enough. You need to play to your strengths, while minimizing your weaknesses. If you are an artist who wants to start your own company and are not business savvy, either educate yourself or find a partner who complements you. I recommend reaching out to a network of mentors and those who have succeeded in the area that you are passionate about so that you can learn from their experiences and mistakes.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Izzy Lopes:</strong><br />\r\nDare yourself to be successful. &nbsp;Extinguish the &quot;what ifs&quot; and replace them with &quot;why nots?&quot; &nbsp;Also, my response to the &quot;now is not the right time&quot; argument is: &quot;when will it ever be right time? What have you got to lose?&rdquo;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/QA2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px\" />If you&rsquo;re passionate about fashion and charity, join us at a fashion show to benefit Big Sister Association on Tuesday, February 25th &nbsp;from 6-9pm at the Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel.

You are a network of &quot;sisters&quot; helping over 2,000 girls in our region become their best self. Collectively, you are changing the landscape for girls. Each time a girl takes a chance, moves beyond what she thought she was capable of, she sends a message to the next girl, to her family and to the greater community that change is possible. That girl could become a future CEO, principal, lawyer, mother, and we hope, Big Sister, simply because someone believed it was possible. &nbsp;You are creating a better community not only for your Little Sister but also for Boston and beyond. I hope to see you throughout the year at one of our events, or on the T, or in a school huddled at a table talking to your Little Sister. January may be National Mentoring Month, but as far as I&#39;m concerned, every month is mentoring month. On behalf of the staff and board of Big Sister, thank you for giving your time, spirit, and attention to a girl.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A special congratulations to <strong>Big Sister Tiffany Potter</strong> for winning our first National Mentoring Month raffle prize, a beaded bracelet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With gratitude and appreciation,<br />\r\ndeb</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned for weekly letters of appreciation from our staff to our Big Sisters in celebration of National Mentoring Month!</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post By: Emily Yoder, Coordinator of Corporate and Foundation Relations</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhile our economy is only slowly recovering in most sectors, employment in Science, Technology Engineering and Math (also known as STEM fields) is <strong>growing three times faster</strong> than in non-STEM fields, and employees in this sector<strong> earn 26% more</strong> than their non-STEM counterparts, according to <a href=\"http://2010-2014.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2011/07/14/new-commerce-department-report-shows-fast-growing-stem-jobs-offer-hig\" target=\"_blank\">Commerce Department reports</a>. However, in 2011, <strong>only about a <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/prod/2013pubs/acs-24.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">quarter of jobs</a> in STEM fields were filled by women.</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nResearcher Amanda Griffith found that women were not <a href=\"https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ecoedu/v29y2010i6p911-922.html\" target=\"_blank\">only less likely to begin studying STEM subjects</a> in college overall; women who opted to major in these subjects were less likely to complete these fields of study. Even women who successfully enter careers in STEM are <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Technology/2013/10/07/Gender-bias-not-desire-for-family-driving-women-from-science-field/UPI-84401381182123/\" target=\"_blank\">less likely to remain in these fields</a>, and make less money than their male peers.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n&quot;Gender barriers are hindering women from entering into STEM jobs, and even among those women persistent enough to enter the STEM labor force, transitions out of STEM jobs transpire relatively early on in their careers,&quot; Cornell researcher <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Science_News/Technology/2013/10/07/Gender-bias-not-desire-for-family-driving-women-from-science-field/UPI-84401381182123/\" target=\"_blank\">Sharon Sassler</a> told United Press International.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSo, what can we do? How can we encourage girls and young women to pursue their interests in science, technology, engineering, and math? How can we train them to be leaders and pave the way for gender equality in these fields?&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nFirst Lady <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/ostp/women\" target=\"_blank\">Michelle Obama said</a>, <em>&ldquo;If we&rsquo;re going to out-innovate and out-educate the rest of the world, we&rsquo;ve got to open doors for everyone.<strong> We need all hands on deck, and that means clearing hurdles for women and girls as they navigate careers in science, technology, engineering, and math.&rdquo;</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHere at Big Sister Association, we&rsquo;re trying to clear these hurdles, open these doors, and empower mentors to do likewise. We encourage Big Sisters to <strong>find fun ways to incorporate STEM concepts into their activities with their Little Sisters</strong>, depending on their interests and experiences. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Big Sister Judy and her Little Sister Stacy love going for walks and enjoying time out in nature. As they hiked in the fall, Judy used the changing leaves as an opportunity to discuss photosynthesis with her Little Sister in a casual, natural environment.</li>\r\n\t<li>Big Sister Alice loves computer programming, and uses games to share her passion with her Little Sister Jazmarie. Alice brings her computer to their match activities, and teaches Jazmarie how to draw computer graphics in the educational program, Logo. The pair celebrated Valentine&rsquo;s Day together by drawing a heart in the program!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend encouraging girls and young women in your life to explore STEM through fun, hands-on activities like these! We also partner with local colleges, businesses, and other institutions to show girls STEM careers and concepts. For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The New England Aquarium partnered with us this March, bringing an interactive marine biology exhibit to Little Sisters living in the Bromley-Heath housing development.</li>\r\n\t<li>The Museum of Science partners with us annually, opening their exhibits for girls who are waiting to be matched with a mentor.</li>\r\n\t<li>Volunteers at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) gave girls on our wait list a tour their labs, and planned a scavenger hunt where the girls made balloon rockets!&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>The Society of Women Engineers is taking girls on our wait list to the Microsoft NERD Center to learn about new technology.</li>\r\n\t<li>Microsoft facilitates technology games for Little Sisters at our seasonal events for matches.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>While these partners go above and beyond, anyone can help girls explore science, technology, engineering, and math in everyday situations. If you work in these fields, invite girls to tour your workplace or shadow you for a day. Are you hiking? Use your time in nature to discuss plants and animals. Baking? Learn about the chemistry behind why your cookies are so chewy. Relaxing at home? Watch some Smart Girls at the Party videos. We have plenty of other resources:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Develop some new role models at the <a href=\"http://women.nasa.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">Women@NASA website</a>, which hosts videos and essays of women who make a difference at NASA. They even offer a <a href=\"http://women.nasa.gov/nasagirls/\" target=\"_blank\">virtual mentoring</a> program.</li>\r\n\t<li>Send them to the <a href=\"http://pbskids.org/scigirls/\" target=\"_blank\">PBS SciGirls</a> website, where they can watch videos, play educational games, and even interact with other girls by uploading STEM-related projects that they are working on, while chatting about and voting on other projects.</li>\r\n\t<li>STEM fields not only suffer from a gender gap; they are also significantly lacking in diversity. <a href=\"http://www.blackgirlscode.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Black Girls Code</a> has the goal of introducing coding and technology to girls of color.</li>\r\n\t<li>Looking for a gift for girls ages 5-9? <a href=\"http://www.goldieblox.com/pages/about\" target=\"_blank\">Goldie Blox</a>, invented by a woman engineer, encourages young girls to explore engineering concepts.</li>\r\n\t<li>Chatting with an older girl who is considering career paths? Send her to <a href=\"http://www.engineergirl.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Engineer Girl</a>, which demystifies a variety of engineering fields and profiles women engineers.</li>\r\n\t<li>Discuss current events, and send the girls you know links to <a href=\"https://student.societyforscience.org/sciencenews-students\" target=\"_blank\">Science News for Students</a>.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/programs/digigirlz/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft&rsquo;s DigiGirlz</a> program offers courses where girls can learn to create their own podcasts and build their own websites.</li>\r\n\t<li>The White House put together a <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/04/24/girls-stem-new-generation-women-and-science\" target=\"_blank\">video of exceptional young women</a> who have contributed to STEM fields.</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://adainitiative.org/about-us/\" target=\"_blank\">The Ada Initiative</a> supports women in technology and targets harassment and the anti-woman bias in these fields.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHow do you get the girls in your life excited about STEM? Do you have any other ideas and resources to share?<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Big and Little Sisters looking to get active hopped on the giant inflatable jumping pillow; and, those who sought a challenge tried their hand at riding the mechanical bull. Animal lovers spent time at the petting zoo and cheered for their favorite snouted-contestant in the pig races. Foodies devoured hot cider donuts and caramel apples.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWhile some wandered into the depths of the corn maze and others spent the afternoon picking out the perfect pumpkin, matches at every activity could be seen smiling, laughing and simply enjoying their time together. We caught up with one of these matches, Big Sister Tricia Luong and Little Sister Sharlice, who have been together for more than six years. Here they share what they most enjoy about their relationship and being a part of the Big Sister program!</p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p><em><strong>Blog Post By: Ann Marie Marzilli, Coordinator of School-Based Mentoring</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nHalloween seems to come earlier and earlier every year. Once the back to school pens, pencils and folders are gone, Halloween treats and costumes line the shelves by mid-September. While it seems that stores rush the holidays, maybe it&rsquo;s a good thing that there&rsquo;s plenty of time to shop for costumes. Finding something appropriate for a young girl to wear gets harder every year, and it&rsquo;s even more challenging to find a costume where girls can express their silly, spooky, or creative side.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"//bigsister.images.stage4.getfused.com/Halloween2.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:300px; margin:10px 0px; width:190px\" />Costumes for girls have shifted from the innocence of dressing up to beauty and sexiness. &nbsp;As <strong>Lyn Mikel Brown and Sharon Lamb, co-authors of <a href=\"http://www.packaginggirlhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Packaging Girlhood</a></strong>, say &quot;according to these costumes sold in department and drugstores, in catalogs and online, girls get their power almost solely from their looks. &nbsp;Even the most traditional Halloween type costumes speak to the ultra-feminine and increasingly sexy--pretty witches and gothic princess, sexy genies and hot devils who aren&#39;t scary but plan to &#39;paint &nbsp;the town red&#39; in a stretch velvet leotard with fluffy marabou trim.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe do not need to conform to these Halloween stereotypes; we can help the girls in our lives to choose or create an empowering, confident costume. If you&rsquo;re in a costume store with a young girl and she chooses an outfit that is not appropriate, use it as a teaching moment. Ask her why she chose the costume. Ask her who her hero is, or someone that she admires, and then discuss what dressing up as them would look like. There are lots of great ideas online for making <a href=\"http://spoonful.com/halloween/halloween-kids-costumes\" target=\"_blank\">homemade costumes</a>. Halloween is an ideal time to talk with the young girls in your life about being smart, creative, and thinking outside the box. &nbsp;You and she can work together to create the perfect &ldquo;strong female role-model&rdquo; outfit that she can wear for Halloween. And as Mikel Brown and Lamb suggest, &quot;help her imagine that she has power over more than how she looks...or what prince she attracts.&quot;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Happy Halloween!</strong></p>\r\n",

      "detail": "<p>Big Sister has served 40 girls at the Eliot School in the North End since 2008. There has been a 50% improvement in grades among girls who took part in the program. Principal Traci Walker Griffith is an advocate of our partnership.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>You&rsquo;ve been a Principal at the Eliot School since 2007. Why did you want to start a partnership with Big Sister?</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI started at the Eliot in 2007 when it was deemed by the Department of Education as an &ldquo;underperforming school.&rdquo; I knew the only way to turn around his school was to address the needs of the whole child. There was a lot to be done with the climate and culture of the school and meeting the social and emotional needs of the students. To do this, I needed to find a way for students to have mentors.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>You have been a vocal advocate of the importance of mentoring. Last year we matched ten girls at the Eliot with a Big Sister. Why do you think girls need a mentor?</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nWe must make a commitment to girls and help them develop their self-esteem and confidence. Mentors do that, Big Sisters do that. You will not reach academic achievement with students unless you have healthy, confident young kids. Big Sisters are able to model what a healthy relationship looks like for our girls.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Your daughter had a Big Sister. Did you have any mentors growing up?</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI was lucky enough to form positive and impactful mentoring relationships with coaches, camp counselors, and teachers. My daughter, Elizabeth was a Little Sister. At the time there was a lot going on in her life and she needed an additional adult friend she could turn to. If you ask Elizabeth about her Big Sister she would say that she helped her during a difficult time. It was important to me on a personal level knowing that she had someone there for her.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>When you walk around the school and see matches interacting what do you see?</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI witness happy, smiling faces. A lot of our students work so hard academically and it is imperative we give them an opportunity to take a breath and have fun. This happens when they spend one-on-one time with an adult who really cares about how they are doing. This is why our partnership with Big Sister is so essential to the success of the Eliot School.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>If there&rsquo;s one thing you would want to change for girls growing up in Boston today, what would it be?</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nI wish that every girl in Boston could have the benefit of a Big Sister; an adult female mentor in their life. My hope is that all women, regardless of age, or where they live, can take on the role of a Big Sister and support a girl into her adulthood.</p>\r\n",

In addition to his work on Big Sister&rsquo;s Board of Directors, he is also on the Council with New England Historic Genealogical Society and is a Lifetime Member of the Francis Ouimet Society and Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants. Recently, David co-chaired the Boston Center for Youth and Families Gala, ran the Boston Marathon benefiting the Women&rsquo;s Lunch Place, and participated in the Rodman Ride in support of Big Sister. He currently serves on the 2012 House Committee for the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Boston. David and his wife, Holly McGrath, help direct the charitable efforts of the Highland Street Foundation &ndash; a private family foundation committed to addressing the needs and concerns of children and families in Massachusetts and California, specifically in the areas of education, housing, mentoring, health care, environment, and the arts. To date, the foundation has contributed more than $125 million to non-profit organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When asked what interested him in Big Sister; he said: &ldquo;I believe a positive mentoring relationship can have the biggest impact on someone&rsquo;s life. As a Boston resident, I was well aware of Big Sister&rsquo;s outstanding reputation for serving girls. I was overwhelmingly impressed with CEO Deb Re, the hardworking and dedicated team, and a board truly committed to serving youth in need. I recently attended the Big Brother Big Sister National Conference in California and had the opportunity to hear from fellow mentoring programs. Although each was very inspiring, Big Sister Association of Greater Boston well exceeded cities two or three times our size in making matches &ndash; serving nearly 3,000 girls. it is an honor to be part of such a dynamic, creative, and compassionate organization.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mentoring is clearly important to David, who was fortunate to have had many role models in his own life. &ldquo;My parents continue to be strong guiding influences and my three sisters are an invaluable support system,&rdquo; said David. &ldquo;I am able to look back at various relationships with teachers, coaches, and friends and see how their support, interest, and guidance have enhanced my life. Everyone needs (and deserves) encouragement and this is exactly what Big Sister provides.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>David, who is very active within Boston&rsquo;s philanthropic community, believes that everyone should give back in whatever way they can. &ldquo;I feel that it is a right and a responsibility, and can be in the form of volunteering your time, talents, or resources,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Big Sister&rsquo;s ongoing success is due to its ability to engage supporters in all size, shape, and form. Collectively, this support provides a solid foundation which garners impressive results, generates continued awareness and enthusiasm, and ensures long-term sustainability.&rdquo;</p>\r\n",

We both enjoy the time we have together, whatever it is we are doing. It&rsquo;s about being present.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a Big Sister has helped me be more carefree, a better communicator, and improved my problem solving skills. Justice is 10 and she loves to run, jump, and play. Every time we meet she wants to play tag. She allows me to play in a way that wouldn&rsquo;t happen otherwise in my life. Sometimes she asks me difficult questions, and with the help of my Match Support Specialist at Big Sister, I always try to answer them truthfully and in a way that she will understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All women should become Big Sisters because you get back as much or more than you give.
